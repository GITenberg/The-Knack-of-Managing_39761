<h2>I</h2>

<h2>Analysis</h2>


<p>Someone once said&mdash;probably it was
Mr. Schwab&mdash;that given the right organization
it was no harder to manage the
U. S. Steel Corporation than to operate a
peanut stand.</p>

<p>And Mr. Schwab ought to know, although
no life-sized portrait of him all dressed up
like a peanut vendor has ever been brought
to our attention.</p>

<p>However that may be, his statement is
interesting&mdash;especially interesting because
his appraisal of the job of managing very
nearly approaches ours. In "The Knack of
Managing," you see, much of the emphasis
will be on the fact that the fundamental
PRINCIPLES OF MANAGEMENT apply
to every business alike. And if we may
start out with the premise that managing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Mr. Schwab's Bethlehem Steel Company
is not such a far cry from operating a
pretzel plant or a furniture factory, our
battle is already half won.</p>

<p>THE PRINCIPLES OF MANAGEMENT
vary not at all, however different
may be the MECHANICS OF APPLICATION.</p>

<p>How often the editor, how often the
equipment salesman, listens to that time-worn
tale of woe: "My business is different.
So-and-so can do that sort of thing. But
I make gadgets&mdash;and your conveyors, your
air conditioners or whatever it is you write
about or sell, won't do me a bit of good."</p>

<p><i>Of course</i> his business is different&mdash;different
in its individual characteristics, its
financial, sales, production, labor problems.
But they are only the CLOTHES the business
wears. They may differ from the
clothes of another enterprise as widely as
the frilly importation from the Rue de la
Paix differs from the sleazy issue of the
East Side sweat shop. But underneath the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
clothes the artist knows there is the human
body&mdash;and a study of anatomy is necessary
before he can paint the picture. Beneath
the "clothes" of the business are the principles
of management&mdash;The ANATOMY
OF MANAGEMENT&mdash;the framework
upon which the completed structure is built.</p>

<p>Doesn't it all boil down to something like
the Colonel's lady and Judy O'Grady?
One, presumably, wore a brief peignoir with
a Paris label; the other, a substantial
bungalow apron from a department store
basement. But weren't they "sisters under
the skin"?</p>

<p>Stripped of all the furbelows&mdash;the details
of operation, of tools, of materials&mdash;the
objectives of our steel master, our
peanut vendor, our pretzel maker, our furniture
manufacturer, are one and the same
thing. Their every-day job, in short, is to
<i>get something well done with maximum dispatch
and at minimum expense</i>.</p>

<p>That's management's job. It goes for
every type of enterprise; whether it in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>volves
the use of a million dollars' capital,
or only ten cents' carfare&mdash;or a few minutes
of a man's time. The "clothes" matter not
at all. Beneath them the fundamental
steps in managing are identical. The basic
KNACK OF MANAGING is the same.</p>

<p>Consider one of the simplest forms of
business enterprise&mdash;the delivery of a message.
The errand boy&mdash;if he's worth his
salt and is really <i>managing</i> his job&mdash;does in
principle exactly what the general manager
of the glass plant, the automobile factory,
the textile mill, does when he comes face to
face with <i>his</i> problems. <i>In principle</i>, mind
you.</p>

<p>FIRST&mdash;this is the errand boy managing
his job&mdash;he settles in his mind exactly
where he has to go. Not just over to Federal
Street&mdash;but to 63 Federal. In a word,
he ANALYZES THE BUSINESS or the
job to be done. ANALYSIS, then, is the
first step.</p>

<p>SECOND&mdash;he figures out the shortest,
most economical way to go there. In other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
words, he PLANS THE DOING OF THE
JOB for the least expenditure. PLANNING
is the second step.</p>

<p>THIRD&mdash;shall he walk or shall he ride?
Shall he do the work himself? Or shall
he hire someone else to do it for him? His
third step, you see, is ORGANIZATION.
He organizes the handling of his work.
The "right organization," said Mr.
Schwab&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>FOURTH&mdash;he must get service. There
are other errand boys. There are elevator
men, office boys to meet and get along with
if he is to execute his errand with the greatest
dispatch. Now, you see, he's HANDLING
THE HELP. The manager of the
piano plant, the agent of the cotton mill,
would call that phase of his job INDUSTRIAL
RELATIONS.</p>

<p>FIFTH&mdash;All the time he's planning, going
and doing, he never loses sight of the
final object of his errand. He never forgets
he has a message, perhaps a bunch of
securities, to deliver. He keeps his eye on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the parcel he's carrying. He gets a receipt
before he lets go of it. In other words, he
SUPERVISES AND CARES for his business.
The manager of the shoe shop, of
the furniture factory, never forgets the final
objective. After all, it's PROFIT.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 320px;">
<img src="images/illus008.jpg" width="320" height="640" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Now look at the chart. It pictures THE
ANATOMY OF MANAGEMENT. The
Chinese say a picture is worth ten thousand
words. And it would take a heap of writing
to tell the story more completely, more
simply than this picture.</p>

<p>Try hanging the "clothes" of your machine
shop, your woodworking plant, your
paper mill, on it. THEY FIT, don't they?</p>

<p>True, the chart is drawn from one of the
most primitive tasks of management&mdash;the
simple delivery of a message. But suppose
the boy doesn't deliver the message himself,
but has an assistant. Won't it be necessary
to go through exactly the same
motions? Suppose, instead of one message,
there are <i>fifty</i>. Fifty assistants will be nec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>essary.
Will the job of managing vary a
jot&mdash;or even a tittle?</p>

<p>Now substitute fifty <i>boxes</i> for fifty <i>messages</i>.
The boxes have to be shipped. The
same processes of thought, the same principles
of management, apply.</p>

<p>If, instead of fifty boxes to be <i>shipped</i>,
fifty machines are to be <i>manufactured</i>&mdash;or
if instead of fifty machines it's fifty
thousand, and a thousand men and a million
dollars of capital are to be employed,
every one of the five principles shown on
the chart will be used. And every essential
point in the management of the <i>business</i>
could be covered by those five fundamentals.</p>

<p>Now substitute ships or shoes or breakfast
food for the machines we have been
talking about, and it becomes clearer than
ever that this BUSINESS OF MANAGING
recognizes no industrial fences.
Learn to manage a peanut stand and, in
principle, you are well on the road to know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>ing
how to handle the affairs of the U. S.
Steel Corporation.</p>

<p>Five steps there are: (1) Analyze; (2)
Plan; (3) Organize; (4) Handle; (5) Supervise.
Tackle any job on this basis and
follow through. The chances that success
will crown your efforts far outweigh the
possibilities of failure. At least, approaching
a job from these five successive angles
should limit the causes of failure to circumstances
quite beyond your control.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>FIVE PRINCIPLES OF MANAGEMENT,
then. Their skillful application
to a business or to a job is the KNACK OF
MANAGING.</p>

<p>To do a real bang-up job of managing,
whether carrying a message or directing a
million-dollar business, the first step is:
<i>Don't make a single move until you've
found out exactly what needs to be done.</i></p>

<p>But our first Do turned out to be a
Don't. So let's restate it. <i>Find out ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>actly
what has to be done before you make
a single move.</i></p>

<p>You've heard that before? And it
doesn't mean a thing?</p>

<p>Neither did it mean a thing to a bright
young man who was taken on as production
manager in a shoe factory. The shoes
were good. Prices were right. Business
was booming. The factory was full of
orders.</p>

<p>But somehow or other shoes weren't getting
shipped on time&mdash;or anything like on
time. Three to four weeks late came to be
the customary thing. And customers were,
needless to say, kicking like steers.</p>

<p>So the bright young man was taken on
to get things ironed out.</p>

<p>He pitched in with vim and vigor.</p>

<p>The first morning's mail brought a dozen
complaints of slow deliveries. People were
practically barefoot out in Kansas and
Ohio. They were waiting for those shoes.</p>

<p>"Ha!" said the new production manager,
"<i>Nous verrons.</i>" Which means, even in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
English, "Now, for what we are about to
see, make us truly thankful." And he went
away from there to see why those orders
weren't out the door.</p>

<p>He was out to prove something. And
Providence&mdash;Rhode Island&mdash;had supplied
him with enough ammunition to shoot a
manufacturing organization full of holes.</p>

<p>Each order was traced. One was in the
shipping room.</p>

<p>"What's holding this up?" he asked the
shipping clerk.</p>

<p>"Haven't had time to ship it. And we
got other shoes that have been waiting
longer than those. It's a feast or a famine
down here. Some days we just can't get
'em out."</p>

<p>"You're working short-handed. Get a
couple more packers. You've got to get
those shoes out. The customers are hollering
like hell. Get 'em out!"</p>

<p>He found another order up in the cutting
room. But why report the conversation?
It varied only in the number of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
cusswords used. It was always the old
story.</p>

<p>"Can't be done."</p>

<p>"Put more people on then. Will two be
enough? Or had we better make it three?"</p>

<p>All down the line it went. More people.
Costs went up. And did orders get out?
Oh, yes, some did. But they got out at the
expense of others. There was more congestion
than ever. Complaints increased.</p>

<p>Then the big boss called him in&mdash;and
down&mdash;pointed out the increasing costs and
asked how come. So the new production
manager went back over his trail demanding
retrenchment.</p>

<p>"Put 'em on" was changed to "take 'em
off."</p>

<p>The big boss tells the rest of the story.</p>

<p>"He had simply jumped in without finding
out what it was he had to do. Maybe
it was my fault for giving him too much
rope.</p>

<p>"Anyway, he hanged himself&mdash;or rather
we had to fire him. Then we took on a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
quiet lad who had served his apprenticeship
with a large electrical supply house.</p>

<p>"He didn't know a twelve-iron sole from
a three-quarter foxing. But he knew
plenty about managing, as it turned out.</p>

<p>"I watched him. Things were in a bad
way, you see, and getting no better fast.
He did nothing much for several days but
read his mail. Sat around his office.
Didn't make a move to boss anyone. Stuck
his nose in here and there to find out what
this clerk or that clerk was up to.</p>

<p>"But no action. No tearing his shirt.
No nothing. And the complaints were
coming in with every mail. They never
fazed him. One day I ran across him up in
the fitting room. Another time I bumped
into him he was picking lasts out of the
bins. Again I saw him pushing empty
racks into the heeling room elevator.</p>

<p>"Apparently I had picked another lemon.
Looked like the best thing he did was sit
around and tap his teeth with a pencil.</p>

<p>"He fooled me, though. One afternoon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
he dropped into my office with a map.
He'd drawn it between taps. It was a good
map with dotted lines to show just exactly
what happened to an order&mdash;any order&mdash;every
order. That map showed when it
went into the works, where it went from
there. And so on until it went out the
shipping room door. That's what he'd
been up to the day I saw him picking out
lasts. And I tell you I never had any idea
how many things could happen to an order.
I never realized how shoes halted and stumbled
and staggered around that factory of
ours.</p>

<p>"There were red lines, too. They
showed the changes he proposed making.
Here he would stop backtracking. Here
was unnecessary travel. Here was an old
bottle neck and here was how he was going
to crack it open. And look at those lasts
lying idle with shoes upstairs waiting to be
made on them!</p>

<p>"That wasn't half. It was actually taking
four days to get orders through the of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>fice
routine. He showed me how certain
necessary records that took time to make
could be made after the shoes were in
work. Other short cuts would wipe whole
days off our schedules.</p>

<p>"There was nothing to it&mdash;when you saw
it in red ink. In fact there's nothing half
so convincing as red ink. There's been none
on our books for the past five years&mdash;and
during that time the shoe business has
been no bed of roses.</p>

<p>"What he proposed was simple as pie&mdash;if
only someone had stopped to think.
We'd simply got into bad habits. We were
handling the work the same way we'd
handled it back in the days when grandfather
started the business. And this fellow
had been smart enough to wait and
wonder why. Not wonder why either. <i>He
went and found out how come.</i></p>

<p>"In thirty days we were back on earth.
We were getting shoes out on time&mdash;many
many days sooner than we'd even been able
to before. And all because a smart young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
man, who didn't know a thing about shoes
but a whole lot about managing, sat and
tapped his teeth and drew a few pictures.&mdash;All
because he had been in no hurry to
act until he had found out just what had to
be done."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is so easy to jump to conclusions! If
you look about a bit, you will see plenty
of men who don't stop to find out what
needs to be done before they start trying
to do it. They're like the shortstop who
hurries his play and tries to throw the runner
out at first before he really gets his
hands on the ball. An error is more often
than not the result.</p>

<p>MANAGING, such men will tell you, is
putting "pep" and "punch" into your work.
Pep and punch were once good words. But
their good qualities have been so often extolled
that most of us have lost sight of
the fact that all the "drive" in the world
is so much wasted energy when it isn't di<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>rected
along the right lines. And when it
isn't so directed, it comes pretty close to
being the lowest form of human endeavor.
Witness the "go-getter" who really doesn't
know what it's all about, but often succeeds
in covering up a world of defects under a
cloak of ill-directed energy.</p>

<p>Other men think they are finding out
what needs to be done when actually they
aren't even getting close to the root of the
matter. With the best intentions in the
world, they are grasping at the first straw
the wind blows their way. Eureka! they
shout when they haven't found it at all,
but are merely jumping all the way over
the facts to conclusions! Actually to know
your business or your job demands ANALYSIS.</p>

<p>You have a right to duck. It's another
of those words that work overtime and
have suffered as a result. A certain type
of superficial business executive has done
analysis no good. To him the impressiveness
of the word suffices&mdash;to the complete<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
exclusion of the simplicity of the act itself.
And so analysis to you and <i>you</i> and YOU
has come to mean involved, complex research&mdash;running
around a lot in circles and
getting exactly nowhere. Analysis has become
for you an A1 example of the phrase-maker's
art.</p>

<p>REAL ANALYSIS of any problem in
business can, however, be simple&mdash;in fact,
<i>it can be nothing else but simple</i>.</p>

<p>Analysis, says Noah Webster, is "a resolution
of anything, whether an object of
the senses or the intellect, into constituent
parts or elements; an examination of component
parts, separately or in their relation
to the whole."</p>

<p>Whooee! all that when he might have
said "TAKING TO PIECES." For analysis
is literally that&mdash;taking a thing to
pieces to see what makes the wheels go
round. Not, however, with the destructive
intent of the small boy who strews his
watch all over the floor, but with the
avowed purpose of getting right down to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the sort of brass tacks which make it possible
to see the composition of the whole
clearly and plainly.</p>

<p>Analysis which befogs the issue is not
analysis at all. It's&mdash;in the vernacular&mdash;a
lot of "hooey."</p>

<p>But the RIGHT KIND OF ANALYSIS
"breaks down" the problem into its component
parts&mdash;without losing sight of each
part's relation to the whole. There may
be only two parts to a job of managing.
The messenger who analyzes his business
correctly will find exactly two: where to
go and what to do after he gets there&mdash;the
simplest kind of problem and the simplest
type of business analysis. But if the analysis
consisted of twenty pieces instead of
two, it would be no harder; it would only
be longer.</p>

<p>The production manager in the shoe factory
analyzed his job correctly when he
mapped out the route of an order. All he
did was take the manufacturing process to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
pieces so that he could put the pieces together
again to form a more efficient whole.</p>

<p>So whether there are two or twenty or
two hundred pieces, the act of ANALYZING&mdash;of
TAKING TO PIECES&mdash;differs
only in the amount of territory it covers.
Naturally it will be a somewhat more
lengthy process to analyze the job of managing
a steel mill than to separate a peanut
stand and its operation into a few component
parts. But the approach is always the
same.</p>

<p>And no matter how good you may be
with the woods, how the approach does
affect the final score!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Consider for the moment that you
have a house built of blocks and want
to take it to pieces. A quick and easy way
of separating it into its component parts
would be a swift kick aimed down around
the foundations.</p>

<p>A quick method. But comes nothing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
There are all your blocks lying on the floor,
but so far as knowing what they're all
about, you're worse off than ever you were
before you kicked your house down.</p>

<p>The other way of taking your house of
blocks to pieces is to start with the roof
and WORK BACKWARDS. The very
thought, then, of "taking to pieces" suggests
the correct way to undertake the
analysis of a business or of a job.</p>

<p>And a study of the methods of successful
managers will convince the doubtingest
Thomas that starting at the top and working
down to the cellar is the method they
follow in the analysis of any business problem
they have to tackle.</p>

<p>Once a busy ceramic manufacturer found
himself in the restaurant business. He
knew about all there was to know about
dinnerware up to the point where it left
his customers' counters. What went on
after that was pretty much Greek to him
if you know what we mean.</p>

<p>And then he became a restaurateur. All<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
because his brother-in-law got into him for
several thousand dollars and then couldn't
quite seem to make the darned thing pay
a profit.</p>

<p>Brother-in-law knew the game. Oh, yes.
He had worked for a number of years as
assistant manager in a similar enterprise.
With his "knowledge of the business," he
should have made a success of this cafeteria
of his.</p>

<p>He knew how to handle the help, how to
buy, how to run the kitchen, and so on.
The operating details were as an open book
to him. Judged from every outward appearance,
the cafeteria was up to standard.
It should have climbed out of the red in
short order.</p>

<p>He had been taught to buy carefully and
to manage economically. "Well bought,"
he announced, "is half sold." He'd read it
in a book and he thought he was being a
good salesman. Still the business stayed in
the red.</p>

<p>Our ceramic friend was faced with kiss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>ing
his investment goodbye&mdash;and probably
with making a job in the pottery for a
good restaurant man&mdash;with throwing good
money after bad, or with getting into the
cafeteria business.</p>

<p>He figured this business ought to pay.
Somewhere, he knew, his brother-in-law
had gone wrong. Just where, he believed
he could find out.</p>

<p>So he took over the business. Brother-in-law
stayed on, leaving the new owner
free to observe.</p>

<p>And he did nothing but observe for a
solid week.</p>

<p>Each night he made a list of the points
in managing which had come up in the
course of the day's work.</p>

<p>In a week's time he had an accurate list
of all the actual jobs of managing, as all
bills except for gas and light and rent were
paid and a profit and loss statement was
taken each week.</p>

<p>Then he arranged the list in order of
natural importance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>It began with marketing and checking
bills with deliveries, and ended with counting
the money and depositing it in the
bank.</p>

<p>"Hold on," he thought, "this isn't such
a long way from running a pottery. What
am I in this business for?"</p>

<p>"Because," he answered, "I want to
leave as much of that money in the bank
as possible, and mark it down as profit."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">
<img src="images/illus026.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>So right away he started to draw pictures.
The chart on this page is the result
after he had worked it over and polished
it up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Note how it works backward from his
final objective&mdash;"Net Profits."</p>

<p>"Now," questioned his <i>alter ego</i>, "how
do I determine how much of that money
stays in the bank as profit, and how much
has to be checked out right away for expenses?"</p>

<p>And from his handy list of managerial
functions it was plain that it depended on
three things&mdash;buying right, selling with as
little waste as possible, and keeping expenses
down.</p>

<p>"Now we're getting somewhere," he said
to himself. "Those things lead me right
into my next job&mdash;which is to fix prices
fairly. For what's the use of buying right,
handling supplies carefully and keeping expenses
right down to the bone unless my
selling prices cover costs, yield a profit, and
still look reasonable to the public?"</p>

<p>Yes, and the most attractive prices,
backed up by careful buying and all the
rest, wouldn't keep the dollars clinking
merrily over the counter unless the food<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
was so good and the service so excellent
that customers bought liberally and came
back for more.</p>

<p>By this time, you'll note, on taking another
peek at the chart, he had worked
right back to his "Number 1" job&mdash;getting
more customers in.</p>

<p>Thus, by ANALYSIS, he found out definitely
what had to be done&mdash;and what had
to be done first. Brother-in-law thought he
knew, but he had begun at the wrong end.
He had been looking after expenditures
first and receipts last. He was trying to
squeeze a little margin out of his receipts
before he did anything about getting the
receipts.</p>

<p>How different the new owner's viewpoint!
His brother-in-law, he found, was
thoroughly competent. He'd simply got off
on the wrong foot. In the kitchen and the
storeroom, he was a good operator. But
the new owner's place was "out front."</p>

<p>His job was to "get more customers, get
them to spend more&mdash;and to give them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
such good food and service that they would
come back and bring their friends."</p>

<p>He began by spending money. Took out
the gas pipe at the entrance. Replaced it
with a brass rail. Provided a small lounging
room where customers could wait for
their friends. Put in upholstered chairs so
they could be comfortable while waiting.
Put attractive uniforms on attractive serving
girls.</p>

<p>There was an air of good taste about the
place when he got through.</p>

<p>Then he changed the arrangement of the
counters. But you know all about that&mdash;how
the desserts came first so they would
catch your eye before your tray was too
heavily loaded with the heavier part of the
meal. Staples which offered a small margin
of profit were relegated to places in the
rear. Dishes that made the best profit got
the positions up front. Each day he offered
a low-priced "special." Thus he
planned to increase customers' purchases.</p>

<p>And the business began to grow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>That's all there is. There isn't any more.
Today he doesn't own a chain of cafeterias
extending into many cities and feeding
many thousands of people every day at a
good profit.</p>

<p>He's still a very successful ceramic manufacturer&mdash;and
a cafeteria proprietor.</p>

<p>"I flew in the face of tradition," he
says. "'First watch your kitchen' is the
cry of the restaurant man. But I started
with what I wanted&mdash;net profits&mdash;and
WORKED BACKWARD to make conditions
that would provide net profits.</p>

<p>"VOLUME OF BUSINESS had to come
first. I had to get it before I could get a
margin of profit.</p>

<p>"No doubt I could go out in the kitchen
today and save some money. If I went to
market myself, maybe I could save a cent
a pound on my meats. But I can't give up
my attention to the 'front' in order to
watch the 'back.' As soon as I do that I'm
going to be right back where I started."</p>

<p>It would sound like heresy, wouldn't it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
if we hadn't sat in and watched him begin
with his final objective and work back
through the means which make the objective
possible. Only by careful analysis
would he have had courage enough to FOLLOW
HIS PLAN THROUGH to its successful
conclusion.</p>

<p>And here's the amusing sequel. Today,
as he still dabbles at feeding people, he will
admit that he's a better ceramic manufacturer
as a result of his cafeteria experience.
His pottery had always yielded a nice
profit. When he sat down with his sheet
of coordinate paper and analyzed it, he
found his job of management differed not
at all in its fundamentals.</p>

<p>His first job he found was "out front"
getting more customers in. A better
knowledge of markets, a better job of selling,
a better product&mdash;those were the ways
to get the customers in and make them
come back for more.</p>

<p>And his need for a better product led
him out into the plant where he found that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
tunnel kilns with exact temperature control
would more than treble the production
of the old periodic kilns&mdash;and would produce
better ware.</p>

<p>But that's another story. The important
thing, anyway, is not what he found
had to be done in the cafeteria and in the
pottery, but HOW he found it.</p>

<p>He took his business to pieces&mdash;BACKWARDS.</p>

<p>He began with the objective he wanted
to get&mdash;MONEY. It was a simple matter
to find that to get money from the business
he had to get customers to come in and
spend money; that to get customers to
come in he must make his place look like
a good place to come to; that to make his
place look attractive he must spend money
on equipment and thought on the arrangement
and display of food.</p>

<p>And there he had his big job cut out for
him, with the other jobs following along in
natural sequence. It altered the whole
METHOD OF MANAGEMENT.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>How this METHOD OF MANAGEMENT
is applied to your job is shown in
the chart which follows. It's a skeleton of
what the cafeteria man did.</p>

<p>Indeed, it's more than that. For it
shows what every manager&mdash;whether he
manages a steel mill, a punch-press department
or a time-study job&mdash;must do if he
is to get an honest-to-goodness PERSPECTIVE
OF HIS WORK.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/illus033.jpg" width="640" height="310" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>It can be done very simply. Just a sheet
of paper ruled in small squares&mdash;you can
buy it at any stationer's&mdash;on which to fill
in the steps you must take in between what
you have to do and what you seek to accomplish
by it&mdash;and some careful thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
as to just what your job is and why it is
to be done, will develop a true ANALYSIS
of your problems which will beat reams and
reams of typewritten words.</p>

<p>Remember the words of the Chinese philosopher:
"A picture is worth ten thousand
words"&mdash;and reflect how clever these
Chinese are!</p>

<p>The MEANS FOR ACCOMPLISHING
the final objective may be many or few.
You have seen the cafeteria-manager's
problems on the chart on <a href="#Page_24">page 24</a>. Now
turn to <a href="#Page_35">page 35</a> and see what a file clerk
does beside powder her nose from nine to
five.</p>

<p>A bright young lady fresh out of high
school went to work in an editorial office.
There wasn't enough filing to do to keep
her happy from nine to five, so she filled
in with a bit of typing here and a trifle of
routine clerical work there. Thursdays she
hopped over to the neighboring bookstore
and collected <i>Saturday Posts</i> for the editors&mdash;now
she'll have to do that on Tuesday.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
And Fridays she distributed <i>The New
Yorkers</i> to avid readers.</p>

<p>Filing, though, was her main job. When
she first came, the managing editor said
"Here it is" or words to that effect, and
she went to work.</p>

<p>Those files had always been more or less
of a sore point. An editor's mail is nothing
if not voluminous. And every day Flossie
the fascinating file clerk got a mass of data
which she had to stick away. Her great
trouble was finding it again after she'd
stuck it away.</p>

<p>Often she couldn't find it. And pretty
soon she discovered that she got the blame
no matter what was missing&mdash;whether an
important inquiry from Peter B. Stilb or
the editor's pipe cleaners.</p>

<p>She couldn't do a thing about the pipe
cleaners, but she made up her mind that
since she was held responsible when a letter
got lost, she would also have the responsibility
of changing the filing system. The
system, she felt sure, was to blame.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>One day when she was "on her lunch"
and the editors didn't need cigarettes from
the corner drugstore, she sat down and
made an ANALYSIS of her problem. Curiously
enough, she started at the end and
WORKED BACKWARDS.</p>

<p>She WORKED BACKWARDS, not because
someone told her that was the right
way to analyze her job, but probably because
she was only a file clerk and no one
ever told her anything.</p>

<p>"Why," she asked herself, "do I file these
old papers anyway?"</p>

<p>"So I can find them again, quickly and
surely, when they're wanted," seemed to
be the only answer to that.</p>

<p>"What's the right way to file these letters
and papers and data so I can find them
quickly?" was her next question.</p>

<p>"Arrange them like words in the dictionary&mdash;ONE
PLACE, and ONLY ONE
PLACE, where each can be," was only
common sense.</p>

<p>In the filing system which she had in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>herited,
there were a dozen places for each
set of data. There was a file on "Industries"
with sub-files for "Automobiles" and
all the rest; a file for data on "Railroads,"
with two or three sub-files. The file clerk
had to use judgment and discretion in selecting
the heading under which each letter
or piece of data was filed. And she wasn't
hired for judgment and discretion. Sometimes,
too, the editors erred in their descriptions
of the material they wanted.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">
<img src="images/illus037.jpg" width="800" height="590" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>One file, arranged alphabetically&mdash;ONE<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
PLACE TO LOOK, regardless of the thing
looked for&mdash;was the logical conclusion,
viewed from the standpoint of <i>finding</i>.</p>

<p>The managing editor was horrified. Mix
"railroads" with "public service," and
"manufacturing" with "agriculture"?</p>

<p>"Why," asked the file clerk, looking back
at her analysis, "why care how things are
<i>kept</i> so long as they can be <i>found</i> quickly?
When you send me for Camels, do you care,
so long as you get them quickly, whether
they're kept next to Chesterfields, or right
beside the chewing gum? When the chief
asks for data on 'C.P.R.' does he care, if
he gets it right away, whether it was filed
next to data on 'Coal' or beside facts about
other railroads?"</p>

<p>"All right," objected the managing editor,
"suppose someone asks for all the data
we have on railroads?"</p>

<p>Not a bad question. It was from a <i>finding</i>
standpoint.</p>

<p>"Have a separate cross-index by classes,"
was the answer. "That is, under 'Railroads'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
have a card showing the name of every&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But look at the extra work."</p>

<p>Back to her ANALYSIS went the file
clerk. "Why file at all, except to make it
easy to find what we file? If we were to
set up a system for <i>easiest filing</i>, we'd simply
put everything in boxes just as it comes
to us. Our main objective is to make information
easy to <i>find</i>, and anything that
increases the work of filing but lessens the
work of finding, is profitable."</p>

<p>The result was a filing system that has
made a great mass of data as accessible as
the words in the dictionary. And it has
taken the human equation out of the job.
No longer does the file clerk have to stop
and use her judgment as to where she shall
file Mr. Stilb's letter. There is ONE
PLACE AND JUST ONE PLACE.</p>

<p>And the basis of the plan was the simple
process of ANALYZING&mdash;of starting with
the final objective and WORKING BACK<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>WARD&mdash;not
forward from the work to be
done.</p>

<p>In hundreds of business offices&mdash;in
countless industrial plants&mdash;time, labor and
money are being wasted today in outmoded
methods which, like Topsy, "just grew."
The manager who started them didn't stop
to reason out first exactly what had to be
done&mdash;or if he did, he failed to WORK
BACKWARD from the final objective.</p>

<p>One way is as bad as the other.</p>

<p>In fact, it may even be better not to reason
at all than fail to get to the very bottom
and reason out the absolute right of what
has to be done. At least it takes less time.</p>

<p>A sure way, incidentally, to avoid making
mistakes in your analysis is to do it
on paper. A professor of mathematics in
one of the large universities always tells
his students that no problem should be performed
in the head that can be done on
paper. "Make pencil and paper do as
much as you can, for your brain has enough
to do to supervise the work."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Until your mind is trained to the habit
of QUICK, ACCURATE ANALYSIS,
you'll find it helps to do the work on paper.
Keep on hand a small supply of blank
charts like the one on <a href="#Page_31">page 31</a>, on which
to sketch an analysis of new work or of
important decisions. The constant performance
of this detail will of itself train
your mind to look at problems more analytically,
and automatically to sift and
classify them more logically.</p>

<p>Perhaps you can improve on the chart
shown on <a href="#Page_31">page 31</a>. Surely you can adapt
it better to your own needs. But force
yourself to some such method. It will help
you to cultivate the instinct of SHREWD,
RAPID ANALYSIS&mdash;and at the same time
it cannot help giving you a KEENER,
SURER INSIGHT into the particular
problem, no matter how complex or how
simple it may be.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is the apparently simple
problems that need analysis most. For
example&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>Did you ever hear of a sales organization
that didn't have a stenographic problem?</p>

<p>The New York office of a Western factory
was no exception. The manager was
broadminded&mdash;even liberal&mdash;with his salesmen.
But when it came to stenographers,
he was decidedly Scotch. Valuable men
sat around the office mornings and evenings
waiting for a chance to dictate to a staff of
girls which was measured to fit the average
load of the day, but not the rush load of
the two hours a day when the salesmen
were inside.</p>

<p>Dictating machines seemed to be the answer.
The sales manager figured they
would not only solve the dictation problem,
but would further reduce stenographic
costs.</p>

<p>They were installed. At the same time
the stenographic force was cut to insure
keeping all the girls busy all the day.</p>

<p>Good. The salesmen were able to dictate
when they felt like it. But often the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
letters dictated were a day or two late in
being transcribed.</p>

<p>Complaints increased. And the manager
lost his temper: "What's the matter with
this cursed letter-writing business?" he
demanded. "Why the Sam Hill do we have
typists and stenographers?"</p>

<p>Well, why? He calmed down a bit, seized
a sheet of paper and mapped out his problem.</p>

<p>This is what he wrote:</p>

<p>1. Salesmen's letters are to save salesmen's
time and to give prompt service to
customers.</p>

<p>2. I don't begrudge half a day's time of
a $20-a-day salesman to call on a customer.
Then it's still profitable to waste half of
the time of a $4-a-day stenographer in order
to save a long trip for a salesman, or
to get a quick answer to a question.</p>

<p>3. What we need is enough typists to
transcribe every letter of every salesman
promptly, even if part of them have to be
idle half the day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>The increased use of sales letters, the
greater freedom salesmen feel in their dictation,
the number of selling details now
promptly handled by mail without an expensive
call&mdash;all are directly traceable to
the manager's ANALYSIS which he made
by using the final objective as a starting
point.</p>

<p>He's a convert to the pencil and paper
method. Sales problems are part of his
daily exercise. He goes to the bottom of
them instinctively. But any problems that
arise concerning office work, he settles only
after analyzing from front to back&mdash;on
paper.</p>

<p>His method of charting his ANALYSIS
differs in appearance from the chart on
<a href="#Page_31">page 31</a>, but it is identical in PRINCIPLE
AND EFFECT. It works from final objective
BACKWARD.</p>

<p>One more application of the same
KNACK OF ANALYSIS&mdash;and we are
done. It is that of an Ohio manufacturer
who recently put up a new building.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Plans prepared by the architect called
for four stories and a basement. When it
came time to discuss arrangement of space,
it was found that one department would
have to go in the basement. There were
objections from all sides.</p>

<p>The manufacturer ended up by taking
the problem home with him to TAKE TO
PIECES and put together again.</p>

<p>He began&mdash;fortunately&mdash;with the final
objective. "What's this new building for?"
Obviously, to provide more space for enlarged
operations.</p>

<p>"How much space is needed?"</p>

<p>He went over the figures and plans and
found the four main floors weren't enough.</p>

<p>"Then why not a fifth floor?"</p>

<p>As long as a bigger building was to be
built, why not make it big enough? Why
not another full story instead of a basement?</p>

<p>Why not, indeed! Come to find out, no
one knew just why a basement had been
considered. The old building had one, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
apparently that was the only reason for
proposing one for the new building. A full
story would give all the general storage
space of a basement and also give regular
working quarters for the department
crowded out of the four upper floors.</p>

<p>And when the architect was consulted,
it was found that with the extras for excavation,
waterproofing and the like, the cost
of a basement was considerably more than
the cost of another full story.</p>

<p>Yet, but for the manufacturer's analysis
of the building problem from the point of
final objective, the basement would have
gone in&mdash;simply because NO ONE HAD
STOPPED TO THINK, and think clearly
and logically.</p>

<p>Logical thinking is a trait that can be cultivated.
Every problem thought through
by means of some such simple help as we
have suggested, makes the mind more
ready to tackle the next problem.</p>

<p>Some men's minds grow so keen by practising
that sort of thinking that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
AUTOMATICALLY TAKE THINGS
TO PIECES as they listen. Before you
finish talking to them, they have already
analyzed your statement and are planning
on its execution&mdash;or are ready to reject it.
Sometimes it's intuition. But rarely.
Usually, it is nothing more than cultivated
KNACK.</p>

<p>Cultivate ACCURACY first. SPEED
OF ANALYSIS will come of itself.</p>

<p><i>Don't start until you know exactly where
you're going.</i></p>

<p>There is no task so trifling, no business so
large, that its management does not need to
ANALYZE EXACTLY WHAT THERE
IS TO DO.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<h2>II</h2>

<h2>Planning</h2>


<p>In the preceding chapter we have been
busily engaged in taking things to
pieces. Now we've got to put them together
again. Our house of blocks has
been resolved into its component parts, not
by aiming a swift kick at its midriff, but
by starting at the top and working backwards.
Now to REBUILD.</p>

<p>Our first care, at this stage of the
game, is to remember that ANALYSIS
IS NEVER AN END but simply the
MEANS TO AN END.</p>

<p>The immediate end, this time, is to rearrange
the pieces so that the job to be
done can be done in the most effective way&mdash;the
way that saves the most effort, the
most time, the most money&mdash;the way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
which, in your business&mdash;and in <i>yours</i> and
YOURS&mdash;leads to NET PROFITS.</p>

<p>Again it should be emphasized that NET
PROFIT, in any job of managing, is the
ultimate goal.</p>

<p>Our danger, then, is that we may find
ourselves down on the floor surrounded by
our blocks&mdash;and with never a trace of a
PLAN for rebuilding the house, and rebuilding
it in the simplest, most economical
way.</p>

<p>In short, we must be sure we are taking
things to pieces, not for the sake of taking
them to pieces, but purely and simply <i>to
find out what has to be done</i>.</p>

<p>Like the golfer who played golf so much
in order to keep fit for golf, we have here
a good old-fashioned beneficent circle.
ANALYSIS without a PLAN isn't worth
a whoop in Hades. It's time kissed goodbye.
Wasted effort. And, in like manner,
a PLAN without an ANALYSIS isn't worth
the paper it's typed on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Psmith in your office is a great "planner".
He always has something on the
fire. But somehow or other he never quite
puts things over. His plans don't get across.
Why not? Oh, just because he doesn't
bother to analyze his problem&mdash;because he
sets out to <i>do</i> what has to be done even
before he <i>knows</i> what has to be done. He
doesn't base his plan upon an actual need.</p>

<p>Pbrown, on the other hand, is a keen
analytical thinker. A student. He's a
shark at taking things to pieces and finding
out what has to be done. But when he's
done that, he's all done. He lacks the
initiative that starts things moving. He
hasn't that divine spark of something or
other that gets things done. A stick of
dynamite wouldn't do a bit of good. He
simply hasn't the knack of building a plan.
He knows what has to be done. He doesn't
know how to do it.</p>

<p>Psmith and Pbrown&mdash;or Pbrown and
Psmith&mdash;would make a fast team. But
Psmith without Pbrown's analytical ability,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
or Pbrown without Psmith's capacity for
planning how to get things done, isn't
worth his weight in gold to <i>any</i> business
enterprise.</p>

<p>A manufacturer friend tells an amusing
yarn about a Pbrown he hired as sales
manager.</p>

<p>"He went around analyzing everything
from soup to nuts&mdash;the gadgets in our line,
our markets, our competition, our salesmen.</p>

<p>"He was an analyzer <i>de luxe</i>. And all
I ever got out of all his analyses was a distinct
feeling that something was wrong with
every gadget we made, that our markets
were saturated, that our competitors had
us backed off the map, and that our salesmen
were a bunch of ribbon clerks.</p>

<p>"So," he continues, "I did a little analyzing
all my own. And analyzed him out of
his job. Today he's managing a filling station
where they drive in for the most part
and take it away from him. But in his
place I got a man who found out what was
wrong with gadgets, markets, salesmen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>&mdash;and
right away he built a plan which sold
goods."</p>

<p>Thus the futility of ANALYSIS without
PLANNING.</p>

<p>There's the danger, too, of getting
away from the SIMPLICITY OF TRUE
ANALYSIS.</p>

<p>A job undertaken by an advertising
agency for a rubber manufacturer supplies
a case in point. Stripped of all the details,
the task was to find out whether or not the
manufacturer might profitably engage in
the making of hard rubber tires for industrial
trucks and trailers. If names are
changed and products substituted, think
nothing of it. The principle's the thing.</p>

<p>The agency began by analyzing the business
to a fare-you-well. Everyone and
everything got cross-examined.</p>

<p>It took three months. And when the
analysis was done it told the manufacturer
everything from where the rubber grew to
where the money went to and came from.
The trouble was, he knew all that before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>&mdash;or
as much of it as he wanted to know.
The report, in the words of a Chicago columnist,
was just "64 dam pages." It
didn't tell him one blessed thing he wanted
to know. Or rather it was so full of plunder
that he couldn't make head nor tail
of it.</p>

<p>It wasn't SIMPLE. And because it
wasn't SIMPLE, it was a far, far cry from
TRUE ANALYSIS.</p>

<p>Well, well, the rubber manufacturer
went out in the byways and got him a
young man who was told to find out, if he
could, whether or not there was any market
for hard rubber tires on gas and electric
industrial trucks, tractors and trailers, and
allied equipment.</p>

<p>He found, for example, that there were
40,000 trucks and tractors in service; that
annual sales were about 3,200 units. He
discovered that, of trailers and hand lift
trucks, 125,000 each were in service; annual
sales were 12,000 and 10,000 units
respectively. But when he came to floor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
and hand trucks, conservative estimates
showed 8,000,000 in use, while annual sales
were in the neighborhood of 250,000!</p>

<p>Next he found out, as accurately as possible,
how many hard rubber tires were sold
as original equipment. The 3,200 trucks
and tractors had 12,300 wheels. But 95
per cent of them were equipped with rubber
tires at the factory. On the other hand,
only 7 per cent of the floor and hand trucks
were thus equipped!</p>

<p>Outside of the truck and tractor people,
he found the equipment makers opposed
to hard rubber tires. Let's not go into the
reasons. Yet representative manufacturers
in a dozen different lines stated, when he
asked them: "All future equipment purchased
by us will be equipped with rubber
tires."</p>

<p>The whole report wasn't twelve pages
long. And three tables, carefully compiled
from available facts and figures, told the
manufacturer everything he wanted to
know.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>In short, upon this SIMPLE ANALYSIS,
he was able to build a plan for manufacturing
and merchandising solid rubber
tires. Much good, though, it would have
done him had he done his planning first
and then found out there weren't enough
wheels to wear the tires after he had made
them!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So much for our "beneficent circle."
Let us look into this thing called PLANNING
and find out if there isn't some way
of developing a knack of planning which
will help us over the second major hurdle
in our road to managing.</p>

<p>There is, we shall find, a single problem
with which the planner, the constructive
manager, deals. Again, it doesn't make a
particle of difference whether it's Mr.
Schwab and Bethlehem Steel or Tonio and
his peanut stand. No business is so "different"
that the principles of management
fail to apply.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>All right, then. The problem of every
planner is first to determine what is the
PRIMARY MOVING FORCE&mdash;the "initiative"&mdash;behind
his job, and then to find
the EASIEST PLACE TO APPLY THAT
FORCE in order to set up the required
MOTION or ACTIVITY with the LEAST
AMOUNT OF EFFORT THAT WILL
GET THE BEST RESULTS.</p>

<p>A long sentence. Go over it again and
you will find it is divided into four distinct
parts:</p>

<p>1. Deciding on the PRIMARY MOVING
FORCE with which to set the wheels
in motion.</p>

<p>2. Applying this FORCE at the PROPER
PLACE TO GET EASIEST ACTION.</p>

<p>3. Directing this action along lines
which either offer LEAST RESISTANCE
or assure GREATEST ACCOMPLISHMENT.</p>

<p>4. Bringing the activities to a focus at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the place or time that will best carry the
work to a SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION.</p>

<p>The PRIMARY MOVING FORCE may
be the selection of media in an advertising
plan; it may be the pushing of a button in
the White House which opens a dam in
Arizona, a Century of Progress in Chicago,
or the Annual Convention of Whammit
Manufacturers at Atlantic City; or it may
be the memo from the big boss which gives
the research department <i>carte blanche</i> on a
development project.</p>

<p>To apply this initiative to a place where
it will get QUICK ACTION may be to
suggest an idea in the headline of an advertisement
that will set the reader to thinking
of salmon fishing at Mooselookmeguntic,
or of the time the ice cubes gave out just
when they shouldn't. Or it may be to classify
the output of a factory before shipping
so that freight cars can be packed to best
advantage or so that lowest freight rates
may be secured. Or it may be a simple<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
method of sorting mail so that subordinates
get the jobs they can handle and only the
important business is brought to the president's
attention.</p>

<p>Directing this ACTIVITY along the
lines that ASSURE GREATEST ACCOMPLISHMENT
may be&mdash;in the advertisement&mdash;the
presentation of facts or advantages
which will persuade the reader that
the fishing tackle you manufacture is desirable.
Again, it may be the dovetailing
of a thousand elements in a huge project
like the Russian Five-Year Plan so that an
adequate supply of ore will be available
when the blast furnaces roar into operation;
so that the steel will be on hand when
production in the Cheliabinsk tractor works
is stepped up to meet the requirements of
the new agricultural regime. Or it may involve
the simple sweeping of a floor in a
manner which raises a minimum of dust.</p>

<p>And bringing the activities to a SUCCESSFUL
CONCLUSION may mean
working up the arguments of the advertise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>ment
to the psychological closing of a sale&mdash;to
the point where the ardent member of
the Isaak Walton League figures he can
live no longer without your fishing tackle
and sets out gaily in the general direction
of Abercrombie and Fitch's. Or it may be
coordinating the entire production of a factory
so that the Diesel generator set ordered
by the Santa F&eacute; can be delivered at
the exact date specified in the original order.
Or it may be handling the day's
correspondence on the credit man's desk so
that letters which must "make the Century"
are ready to go at 11:45&mdash;so that the
rest of the day's work is ready to sign,
stamp and mail before the 5 o'clock whistle
blows.</p>

<p>FOUR ELEMENTS, then, in any job
which is to be PLANNED. Every plan, if
practicable, will follow them.</p>

<p>There is, by way of further illustration,
the story of the factory manager of a food
manufacturing plant who laid out a PLAN
for an operation no more intricate than the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
scrubbing of the floors at night. Now it can
be told.</p>

<p>And for two good reasons. First, because
it was a practical plan which, even
on such a lowly operation, saved quite a bit
of money. Second, because in its construction
the plan is, from the point of view of
our four elements, what has sometimes been
called a "natural."</p>

<p>One night, it seems, the manager and his
wife went to the movies. The town didn't
have daylight time, so it was quite dark.
They passed the plant, a large six-story
building.</p>

<p>"Why, Ed!" exclaimed the wife, "you
didn't tell me the factory was working
nights."</p>

<p>Ed, like most husbands, was in the habit
of telling friend wife 'most everything. For
once he was at a loss. Sure enough, the
lights were going full tilt on all floors.
Hitting on all six, you might say.</p>

<p>Then he laughed. It all came to him&mdash;"It's
just the scrubwomen at work."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>One feature picture, one newsreel and
one animated cartoon later, they walked
past the plant again.</p>

<p>"Look, the factory's still lit up," remarked
the wife who turned off the living
room lights religiously when she went out
to get supper ready.</p>

<p>This time Ed didn't laugh.</p>

<p>In days like these one doesn't. Not, at
any rate, at the thought of mounting electricity
bills.</p>

<p>The very next evening he was on the job.
Time somebody found out what was what.
In came the cleaners. They switched on
the office lights&mdash;all of them&mdash;and two of
the crew went to work. A couple of others
went up to the second floor, switched on
all the lights and pitched in with a vim.
And so <i>ad infinitum</i>&mdash;or at least to the
sixth story.</p>

<p>And all the while the electric meter went
round and round!</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours later the janitor had
a new plan of work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>First the manager thought he'd start the
whole crew at the top and work down. On
second thought, a better plan was born&mdash;like
the goddess of wisdom who sprang full
grown from her papa's forehead. If I must
go at this cleaning job, he thought, I might
just as well make a first-class job of it and
save not only on light, but on cleaners, too.</p>

<p>We shall pass lightly over that part of
his plan which had to do with releasing
scrubwomen for other productive work, for
in days like these&mdash;or in any other day&mdash;we
just can't figure out that sort of thing.
But goodness gracious, sometimes it's
necessary.</p>

<p>The emphasis, then, shall be on the electric
current saved. The plan called for the
entire crew's working together on one floor
at a time&mdash;on the well-founded theory, of
course, that teamwork would accomplish
more in less time. Besides, since it was
necessary to turn on all the lights on the
floor, why not get the full benefit from them
by having the entire gang at work?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>So far, so good. The surprise comes
when you learn that he didn't have them
start at the top and work down. He started
them at the bottom and worked them up.</p>

<p>"And I'll tell you why," explained the
manager, "they have to climb six floors
anyway, so they might as well work up as
walk up. Besides, by leaving the stairs till
the last, they can work their way down as
well as up."</p>

<p>In other words, they went to work right
where they came in. And when they had
finished, they were right back where they
started&mdash;back where they went out on their
way home.</p>

<p>Simple, isn't it? An immediate reduction
in lighting bills was noticeable. Even the
amateur mathematician among you can
figure that with one floor out of six lighted
at a time, five-sixths of the light was saved.
Besides, the work was done in less time&mdash;it
wasn't long before two cleaners were
reading the want ads. But why go into
that?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>We aren't, for that matter, interested so
much in the savings made, because it is exceedingly
doubtful if many of us pass our
factories or our offices on the way to the
movies. We may never have an opportunity
to put this particular plan to work.</p>

<p>What we are interested in, though, is the
fact that this cleaning plan utilizes the four
basic elements which we've said must be
present in every job of PLANNING.</p>

<p>Look at the chart. It shows the movement
of energy in the manager's plan for
handling his crew. Starting the scrubbers
on the ground floor&mdash;they had to begin
there anyway, no matter when they began
to scrub&mdash;was nothing but applying the
primary force at the best point to get the
easiest action.</p>

<p>Working them up floor by floor was simply
directing the activity along both the
lines of least resistance and greatest accomplishment.
And doing the stairs on the
way down was just focusing the activity at
the right point for making a successful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
conclusion&mdash;that is, winding up the job at
the exit.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 449px;">
<img src="images/illus065.jpg" width="449" height="640" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Turn back now to the FOUR ELEMENTS
OF SUCCESSFUL PLANNING
as we set them down on <a href="#Page_54">page 54</a>. Try
them out on any successful plan and assure
yourself that not a point has been
stretched. By using them we shall learn
the constructive, creative KNACK OF
PLANNING.</p>

<p>Stripped of the "clothes" which every
plan wears&mdash;it's only in the clothing that
plans differ&mdash;this KNACK OF PLANNING
may be quite simply visualized by
some such chart as the one shown on
the opposite page.</p>

<p>There you see the PRIMARY FORCE&mdash;the
INITIATIVE that sets the PLAN
in action. Second, the POINT OF APPLICATION&mdash;where
you must hit if
you're going to win. Third, the various
activities which bring about the SUCCESSFUL
CONCLUSION. And fourth, all these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
activities headed up at the FOCUSING
POINT.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">
<img src="images/illus067.jpg" width="800" height="481" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>It's just like the sailor off the whaler who
picks up the wooden mallet, hits the
plunger a resounding crack, sends the
weight hurtling up the pole, rings the bell&mdash;and
gets a good 5-cent cigar. Or like the
golfer who, putter in hand, strokes the ball
firmly "in the direction of least resistance
and greatest accomplishment," sees it hit
the back of the cup and drop in for a par
four.</p>

<p>Watch these four essentials. Knowing
them and using them continually will en<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>able
you to break down every job of
PLANNING into its component parts&mdash;will
enable you to develop that important
side of your managing faculties&mdash;whether
your work is merely the carrying out of a
job or shouldering the responsibilities of a
huge business.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Remember the production manager in
the shoe factory? Rather sketchy was
the story of the ANALYSIS he made. Let's
go a bit more into the details of the PLAN
which was based on the ANALYSIS. And,
at the same time, examine it to see if it
checks with our FOUR ELEMENTS.</p>

<p>You remember he was hired to find out
why the so-and-so shoes didn't move out
the door on time. And you'll remember
that instead of clanking up and down from
one department to another, he was seen one
day picking out lasts from a bin in the
assembly room. He had crept up quietly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
on the POINT OF APPLICATION. The
INITIATIVE, you see, or the PRIMARY
MOVING FORCE, was the boss's order to
get shoes to moving.</p>

<p>Here (in the lasting room) was his
POINT OF APPLICATION. The biggest
factor in slowing up shoes, he found, was
failure to have lasts ready the instant the
uppers came down cut and stitched from
the fitting room.</p>

<p>The shoes were entered into work with
almost entire disregard of this vital point.
Oh, yes, they knew they once bought so
many pairs of lasts on this style or that in
such and such sizes. And in a vague sort
of way they tried to regulate the number of
pairs sent to the cutting room with the
number of lasts which they thought should
be available the day the shoes reached the
assembly department where uppers, insoles,
bottoms and lasts met together&mdash;or should
have.</p>

<p>A single missing size could hold up a 36<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>-pair
lot which included a run of sizes all
the way, say, from 7&frac12; to 12.</p>

<p>Today it's all so different. A running
inventory is kept of every active last. Each
day the lasts which are released as shoes
leave the finishing room are added to the
supply on hand; at the same time, the lasts
which are to be used that day in lasting
incoming lots are subtracted.</p>

<p>A job? No, a good girl of moderate intelligence
simply added it to a dozen other
office chores which she finds time to do
daily.</p>

<p>The running inventory, you see, is one
of the various activities which, aimed at the
focusing point&mdash;the moving of shoes out
the door&mdash;are necessary to bring about a
successful conclusion&mdash;the successful conclusion,
in this particular instance, probably
being the saving of the young man's scalp&mdash;for
the boss was certainly out to get it
the day he saw the young production manager
pawing over the chunks of maple in
the lasting room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Other activities might be mentioned.
Plenty of them. An automatic conveyor
which brought back empty racks to the
point where they were needed. Semi-automatic
elevators which made possible the
rapid moving of shoes from floor to floor.
Twelve-pair lots which simplified the handling
problem, made the job of picking out
lasts an easier one&mdash;and all in all did much
to take the weight off management's
shoulders. All these and more are the activities
which were needed to bring about a
successful conclusion. They were all part
of the PLAN.</p>

<p>Today, in that shoe factory, the production
manager sits down for an hour in the
forenoon and an hour in the afternoon and
schedules the next half-day's work which
will go to the cutting room. Two girls
have been moderately busy getting him the
information he needs. Sales have been
brought up to date within half a day. He
knows how many kid shoes he can cut, how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
many calf. He knows which patterns can
be cut by machine, which must be cut by
hand. He knows that certain patterns take
longer to go through the fitting room.
There's extra stitching or fancy perforations.
He must lay off those. And last of
all, he knows what he can count on in the
way of lasts when the shoes hit the lasting
room.</p>

<p>With his two girls, the young production
manager does all the work of scheduling.</p>

<p>Actually, there isn't much work. Management,
you see, has done an awfully nice
job of PLANNING.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Picture now the manufacturer of
small electrical appliances who sought to
lay out new avenues of growth. His was
pretty much a seasonal business. Electric
fans constituted most of his bread-and-butter
production. Early in the year and well
on into the spring his plant ran full blast
getting out merchandise for sale during the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
warm, muggy days when Sirius is in the
ascendant.</p>

<p>And then along in the summer and fall
his production curves went into a serious
decline.</p>

<p>To level them out would have meant
carrying a load of finished inventory which
he could ill afford. Other appliances, such
as hair curlers and driers which might conceivably
find a ready sale during the holiday
season, helped considerably&mdash;but not
enough. The rough places were by no
means made plane.</p>

<p>Why not, thought he, a line of toys which
would enable him to utilize his present production
set-up profitably during the slack
summer and fall? Why not, indeed?</p>

<p>So he set out to chart a plan of action
beginning, as you will see from the figure,
with the furnishing of amusement as the
PRIMARY FORCE. His POINT OF
ATTACK was through the 15,000,000
American boys who love to build something.
On he went to the various ways of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
getting parents interested as the ACTIVITIES
WHICH SHOULD LEAD TO A
SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION&mdash;to the
linking up of those activities with the retail
store as the job of FOCUSING THEM on
the final achievement&mdash;SALES.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/illus074.jpg" width="550" height="800" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Only the bare headings on the plan are
shown in the chart. Nevertheless it shows
clearly the same knack of using the FOUR
ELEMENTS which we have been at such
pains to discuss.</p>

<p>The chart proved helpful, not only in
guiding the management in its efforts to
enlarge the scope of manufacturing activities,
but also in giving the office and the
sales force a true picture of the business.
So helpful, indeed, did it prove that it was
blueprinted. And today every salesman
has one pasted in his selling portfolio. It's
the first thing the dealer sees. And it has
gone far in arousing the latter's interest and
confidence.</p>

<p>If you were a dealer, would you buy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
from a factory that was run by guess and
by gob when you could give your business
to a concern which you knew was functioning
in accordance with a sound, well-formulated
plan?</p>

<p>There, if you please, lies the answer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is not within the purpose of this chapter,
incidentally, to play any favorites.
Time must be taken out at this point, therefore,
to return to the messenger boy who,
when we left him, had just finished analyzing
his job.</p>

<p>Let's see now how his plan of action is
based upon what the analysis taught him.
Let's examine this elementary job of managing,
not because it may make better messengers
of us, but because the examination
will show how universal this thing called
management is&mdash;because it will afford one
more proof of our general axiom that the
principles of management are ever the
same, no matter what particular parapher<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>nalia
of business may be used to cover up
its old bones.</p>

<p>Did, then, the messenger boy work out
his plan in accordance with our FOUR
BASIC ELEMENTS? He did, if he was
really managing his job&mdash;and from the
careful analysis he made, we may assume
he was.</p>

<p>If his trip meant riding a street car, then
going to the cashier for carfare is his primary
force. If he can walk, then the
primary force is simply getting under way.
Hastening as directly as possible to the car
line is applying the force at the easiest
place to get results. Perhaps he might
have to choose between a slow street car
which would carry him right to his destination
for seven cents, and a fast elevated
which, for a dime, would make better time
but leave several blocks to walk at the
other end. Deciding between the two is
directing the activities along lines of greatest
accomplishment. And getting his transfer,
leaving the car, and going straight to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the address on the message, are nothing
more nor less than focusing his activities at
the POINT OF ACHIEVEMENT.</p>

<p>You see? The Colonel's lady in her
Parisian peignoir and Judy O'Grady in her
sleazy slip were sisters under the skin. So,
if we may stretch a physiological point, are
our messenger boy and the man who made
the toys.</p>

<p>The plans of both were built on the same
foundation.</p>

<p>Or take the plan by which the new general
manager of a tap and die concern rehabilitated
his company's business.</p>

<p>"Why," he said, reaching for a pad of
paper and roughly sketching something that
looked like a funnel and must have been
because he said it was, "our manufacturing
plan looked about like this. Up here at the
top we poured in a lot of orders and hoped
to high heaven some of them would finally
trickle through at the bottom.</p>

<p>"Some of them did drop through. Others
dropped because we poked sticks up the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
flue. That is to say, an army of stock
chasers did their level best to keep everyone
happy.</p>

<p>"It was bedlam around the shop. It took
three months on an average to complete an
order.</p>

<p>"I found much of the delay was due to
certain Victorian notions about set-up time.
The prevailing idea was to give an operator
a good big job to minimize that item of
expense.</p>

<p>"Sometimes the job was so big it took 60
days to run it through a single operation.</p>

<p>"Oh, me! oh, my! the inventories of finished
goods that piled up. The tote boxes
full of work in process that cluttered up
the scenery.</p>

<p>"And the complaints from customers who
were waiting for orders!</p>

<p>"Funny thing about our business, you
can't get a customer to accept a couple of
&frac14;-in. taps in place of the &frac12;-in. one he's
ordered.</p>

<p>"So I had to revamp the whole shooting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
match. First on the program was to find
out what was made and what was making.
Then we withdrew from the shop all work
in process except what actually applied on
orders in the house or what was needed to
fill out our stock on an item on which we
had no order, but on which past experience
had taught us we'd get one in the course of
the next 30 days.</p>

<p>"You should have seen the pile of tote
boxes we stuck under the boilers.</p>

<p>"Well, the next job was to figure out the
most economical lots to send through the
works. That figure was arrived at simply
by choosing such a size that no single
operation could possibly take more than a
day. In a word, I made sure that every
single lot would move every single day.</p>

<p>"Do you get the picture? A steady flow
of manufacturing. No funnel. No poking
around with sticks. Today there aren't
any stock chasers. None is needed. Work
reaches the stockroom on time. Orders are
filled complete the same day they come in.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Inventories are lower. Oh, heck, need I
go on?"</p>

<p>No, he needn't. For already he has
shown us how the motive force was applied
at the right point to get results. Take this
plan apart&mdash;or any other plan that really
works&mdash;and you will see that it is built
upon the FOUR ELEMENTS OF PLANNING.</p>

<p>They make the PLANNING wheels go
round.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now it's time to take your own job of
planning to pieces and see if it, too,
does not meet the test.</p>

<p>Here, again, as when the ANALYSIS was
made, it helps to set things down on paper.
In charting, you will find that by painstaking
application of our four principles along
the lines diagrammed in the figure on <a href="#Page_65">page 65</a>,
you can LAY OUT A WORKING
PLAN depending for its approach to perfection
only upon the amount of thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
put into it, and upon the degree of accuracy
with which the analysis of the job was
made.</p>

<p>The chart you make may be only a guide
to the complete plan. Some plans require
details which utterly preclude any form of
expression so simple as a chart. Other
plans can be laid out on the actual chart
shown.</p>

<p>In any event, the very attempt to put
your plan into diagrammatic form will
develop PRACTICABILITY AND ACCURACY
OF ARRANGEMENT. The
very necessity of having to indicate and to
select the primary force back of your job
or business; having to trace that force
through the various activities necessary to
completed work; and then having visibly
and physically to concentrate all these activities
at one point&mdash;those very acts which
making a chart compels you to perform, enforce
a mastery of the essential details of
your business and a grasp of their relations
which every manager should have.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps the plan you have isn't as hot
as you think it is.</p>

<p>An office manager friend of ours was
pretty proud of his system until one day
he charted it.</p>

<p>His company was famous for the quality
of work turned out. But the service it
gave was wretched. Special instructions
were often ignored. Delivery dates were
overlooked. All that sort of thing.</p>

<p>The system looked good enough. The
office manager said the mistakes were due
to carelessness. And it looked as if he were
right. So when something went wrong, the
nearest employee got a handsome bawling
out.</p>

<p>At last the sales force jumped on him
with both feet. Too many promises had
been broken.</p>

<p>So the office manager was forced to do
something about it. And, quite by accident,
made a chart of the ACTUAL PLAN
OF WORK.</p>

<p>Hello, what was this? Half a dozen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
responsibilities were standing around absolutely
unchaperoned, you might say. Someone
might come along and pick them up, or
then again&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>For example, if a customer on the West
Coast ordered a bill of goods, and then,
while the order was in work, decided he
wanted half the goods shipped by boat
through the canal and the other half by fast
freight, maybe he'd get his shipments that
way and maybe he wouldn't. Under the
prevailing "plan" that particular sort of
job didn't fall inside any one man's bailiwick.
No one man was responsible for
seeing that such orders were executed. No
"machinery" had therefore been provided
for taking care of them.</p>

<p>That's only a sample of some of the duties
which landed&mdash;in his diagrammatic
representation of the actual plan of work&mdash;somewhere
off the map. For all the action
they got, they might as well have been
painted ships upon a painted ocean.</p>

<p>Methods in general, you see, were pretty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
much all right. But there was no recognized
initiative back of the plan. Activities
were set in motion more or less spontaneously.
As a result, certain parts of the
business were left without managerial supervision.</p>

<p>Nothing is surer to expose such a condition
than actually to chart a plan. In this
instance, it was simple to recognize "following
customers' instructions"&mdash;no matter
when, why, or how they came&mdash;as the logical
primary force. Then the whole trouble
was taken care of by centering the responsibility
upon the chief of the order department.
From then on, all instructions regarding
any order cleared through him.</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that the idea back
of charting a plan is not to get something
you can work to as an ideal in carrying on
a job, but rather to get a PRACTICAL
FRAMEWORK on which the work can
actually be done. Then it is at once evident
whether the "clothes" of the business
are hanging on the right limb or whether<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
they have been hung up somewhere on the
ground where, like as not, nobody will
bother to pick them up.</p>

<p>Too often the plan turns out to be a
"sketch."</p>

<p>The builder waits until the architect's
first sketch has become a plan.</p>

<p>In business it's like that, too.</p>

<p>When finally you know, from ANALYSIS,
<i>what you want to accomplish</i>, it is not
difficult to plan the procedure if you start
right and forget nothing. You start right
if you take time to figure out the primary
initiative. You forget nothing if you take
the trouble to set things down in black and
white.</p>

<p>And finding the motive force and figuring
out where to hit with it, is nothing more
nor less than charting the moves of the
game until you find a succession of activities
moving along without back-tracking,
without duplication, without wasted effort
or supervision.</p>

<p>Thus cultivating the KNACK OF<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
PLANNING is a long step in the direction
of becoming a good manager. If you were
going to try to tell someone else how to
cultivate the knack of planning, the story
of the two men shaving in the Pullman
washroom serves to illustrate the point.</p>

<p>Both men seemed to be in a hurry. The
first hustled over to one of the wash basins,
scrubbed his face and hands, dried them on
a towel. Then he began to shave. That
finished, he washed the lather from his face,
dried himself again on another towel, and
put away his razor. Next came his teeth.
He brushed them, washed away the traces
of tooth paste, and dried himself on a third
towel.</p>

<p>All this time the other fellow was going
through the same motions&mdash;but in a much
different order.</p>

<p>He began with his teeth. After he had
brushed them, he lathered his face. After
he had shaved, a single wash was enough
and a single towel did the drying job. He
had finished his canteloupe and was well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
along with his eggs before his companion
reached the diner. Number two didn't do a
better job of brushing his teeth, of shaving,
of washing. But he <i>did</i> do a better job of
PLANNING.</p>

<p>He started where each operation would
lead directly and naturally into the next,
performing each at the proper time.</p>

<p>After all, isn't that precisely what you
do in planning any part of your business?</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<h2>Organizing the Work</h2>


<p>Remember Psmith and Pbrown?
One could analyze, but didn't know
what to do with his analysis after he got it.
The other was an expert planner, but alas!
his plans were never based upon the solid
foundation of actual necessity. He planned
to do something before he knew what had
to be done.</p>

<p>Psmith and Pbrown, together, looked
like a grand pair when we introduced them
in the chapter on PLANNING. Now, after
taking particular pains to give that impression,
we shall have to break right down and
confess in open meeting that they are but
two numbers of the MANAGEMENT
TEAM. Probinson is the third.</p>

<p>Probinson ORGANIZES THE WORK.
Psmith may analyze to a fare-you-well;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Pbrown may plan till he's blue in the face&mdash;their
best efforts are as of nothing worth
unless Probinson is on hand to organize the
work of the business. For as surely as
there is a knack of analyzing and a knack
of planning, just so surely is there a knack
of organizing the work.</p>

<p>Thus we approach the third phase of the
job of managing.</p>

<p>So far we have seen how the successful
manager starts from the top, working backward,
to chart his job&mdash;and then, having
found out what has to be done, builds his
plan for doing it. Analysis and planning,
however, will carry him just so far. Unless
he acquires the knack of organization, he
will never make a howling success of his
job&mdash;he will fall just short of being an outstanding
manager.</p>

<p>The office manager for an Eastern concern
affords the needed illustration.</p>

<p>P. C.&mdash;those aren't his initials&mdash;knew
office management from A to Izzard. First
to arrive in the morning, last to leave at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
night, he had a tremendous capacity for
hard labor. But he never seemed to make
a hole in the pile of work on his desk. It
grew no smaller fast. Why? Because he
never, in all his years of managing, learned
to arrange the division of his work. He
never learned to deputize it. When his
mind should have been free for the more or
less important decisions which crop out now
and then even in an office manager's life, it
was all bound around in the necessity of
performing some silly little routine job
which any girl of moderate intelligence
could have done.</p>

<p>His idea of organizing his job was to try
to do everything himself. And within his
physical limitations he was a valuable man
to the company. But how much more he'd
have been worth had he, at some time in
his career, acquired the KNACK OF ORGANIZATION!</p>

<p>Don't jump to the conclusion, now, that
the successful organizer is one who merely
divides up his work and parcels it out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
among a flock of assistants. Don't think for
a moment that it is nothing but deputization.</p>

<p>Effective organization is far more than
that.</p>

<p>It is the distribution of work, according
to its character or urgency, among the facilities
at hand for doing it according to
their capacities or cost. And it makes no
difference whether those facilities happen
to be men, money, or machines&mdash;or simply
your own available time.</p>

<p>You deputize work when you use an
adding machine instead of your head to total
last month's sales&mdash;when you turn the
job of packaging breakfast food over to an
automatic machine&mdash;when you jot down in
your notebook information which would
otherwise tax your memory&mdash;when you
telephone the purchasing agent instead of
making your legs take you to his office&mdash;when,
instead of using your own funds, you
do something on borrowed capital.</p>

<p>Deputization may be any one of these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
just as easily as it may be asking your
assistant to find out why So-and-so's order
for boys' pants wasn't shipped on time, or
making him responsible for working out a
new prospect list.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The office manager of a shoe concern
found, right after the war, that much of
his day was spent telling dealers in Kalamazoo
and Keokuk to be patient, please,
and they'd get their shoes.</p>

<p>Those were the halcyon days, you'll remember,
when salesmen went out twice a
year and told their customers how many
shoes or ships or sewing machines they
could have&mdash;and when they could have
them.</p>

<p>As a result, this particular shoe factory
was loaded to the guards with orders. Orders
were shipped when, as and if they
struggled from cutting room to fitting room&mdash;and
from then on down to the packing
department.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Complaints were numerous. They
weren't exactly complaints, either. Queries,
rather. Where are my shoes? Can't you
ship March 15 instead of April 1? And so
on&mdash;until, as we started to say, the sales
manager was spending a great part of his
time dictating replies to his stenographer.
And she didn't have time for any of her
other duties.</p>

<p>Analysis proved that the letters were, in
the main, of three types. Three letters
were therefore prepared, and each day the
sales manager went through the inquiries
and indicated which letter should go to
which customer. In that way the latter got
a prompt and courteous reply, as well as
certain vague information explaining why
he'd have to wait another month for his
shoes.</p>

<p>And he was moderately happy. Personal
attention from the sales manager
could have accomplished no more. Thus a
certain part of an executive's and his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
stenographer's time was deputized to a
system.</p>

<p>Could the sales manager have gone a step
further and had his letter mimeographed,
he would have been DEPUTIZING TO A
MACHINE the same amount of his own
and a much larger part of the stenographer's
time. But, while the customers accepted
plausible excuses in place of shoes,
it is doubtful whether the cleverest imitation
would have taken the place of a real
typewritten letter.</p>

<p>With the manufacturer of a proprietary
medicine, however, things are different.
Women from every part of the country
write in describing their ailments. It is not
difficult to classify these letters into a dozen
groups. And form letters, done in skillful
imitation of real typing, do the trick quite
nicely.</p>

<p>That is DEPUTIZING&mdash;just as it is
DEPUTIZING when the "big boss" calls
in his assistant and says: "You run this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
shebang from now on. I've got to see if I
can't get the K. C. plant out of the red."</p>

<p>And it's DEPUTIZING when a manufacturer,
forced to increase the size of his
plant, goes to a real estate operator and
gets him to buy a piece of land, put up a
building and rent it to him at a certain
figure, while he uses his own capital to
equip and operate the new plant, because
he can make 15 per cent, say, on his capital
himself, whereas he has to pay out as rent
only an amount equal to 8 per cent of what
land, building, insurance, and so on, would
tie up.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, then, DEPUTIZING is
taking something away from the "principal"
of the job or business and assigning it
to a "deputy." Principal and deputy may
be a manager and his stenographer, a department
head and a filing system, or a corporation's
capital and a bond issue.</p>

<p>The first stumbling step toward organization,
therefore, is to RECOGNIZE and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
DEFINE the PRINCIPAL and the DEPUTIES
in a given task.</p>

<p>A good manager, though, can't simply go
and deputize every detail of his job. That
might be nothing more than the trick of a
lazy man.</p>

<p>Yet a rising young executive (on our list
of casual acquaintances) has done exactly
that. He has carried it to such a fine point
that he is able to spend three afternoons a
week with Col. Bogie. He is still rising,
although some of us have abiding faith in
the old adage that what goes up must come
down. In other words, he's rising to a fall.</p>

<p>No, organizing is not deputizing in that
sense of the word.</p>

<p>In EFFECTIVE ORGANIZING, it will
be noted from the examples cited, work is
deputized <i>only when the "principal" is left
free to do something else more important or
more profitable</i>.</p>

<p>The "big boss" didn't hand the plant
over to his assistant until he knew his undivided
attention was needed elsewhere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>&mdash;until
he knew he could spend his time more
profitably in another phase of the business.</p>

<p>Analyze the conditions under which the
sales manager delegated part of his dictation
to a system, and part of his stenographer's
typing to a duplicating machine.
You will see that the work deputized fulfilled
two conditions:</p>

<p>It was work the system and the machine
could do to advantage&mdash;</p>

<p>And work which he and his stenographer
could do only at the expense of more important
work.</p>

<p>Wherever there is delegation of responsibility
in any true job of managing, the same
two fundamentals will be seen.</p>

<p>Too often a manager says: "Never do
anything your subordinate can do for you."
But it is not good management when turning
a job over to a subordinate leaves the
manager idle and unproductive&mdash;with nothing
on his mind except his hat.</p>

<p>The good manager, whatever may be his
particular job of managing, follows two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
rules when he deputizes or distributes work
to man, money or machine. Such work, he
knows, should be:</p>

<p>1. Work which that other person or
other thing can do to good advantage.</p>

<p>2. Work which the manager would do
himself only at the expense of something
more important.</p>

<p>Deputizing your work so that your days
are free for golfing or yachting is far from
the spirit of true organization. When a
Schwab deputizes, another job profits by
the increased time he is able to give to it.
Every time he passes on a bit more responsibility,
the whole enterprise profits through
his greater freedom for the big sweep of
the business. And when a manager fails
because he has never learned to share responsibilities,
we shudder at his folly&mdash;never
stopping to think that the sole reason
it was folly was because there was a bigger
job for him to do. Deputizing his
work would have left him free to exercise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
big, broad judgment in a way that only
leisure and calmness could afford.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A few years ago, two young men went
into business in a small Illinois town.
They were honest, industrious, well liked.
Austin was a born salesman; Black was a
shrewd buyer. It looked like a good combination
and the local banker gave them a
line of credit.</p>

<p>One year went by. Two years. Austin
and Black were just skinning by. A fair
living was all they were getting out of the
business. Volume&mdash;which was what they
needed&mdash;was increasing, oh, so slowly.</p>

<p>A salesman came along about that time
and told them some things they didn't
know. A little more skill in watching the
stock; cutting out lines which weren't paying;
trimming purchases on slow-moving
stocks; pushing specialties before they went
bad on their hands&mdash;those were some of the
methods which meant added profits.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>It certainly looked like good business to
hire another clerk so that the partners' time
would be free for these new phases of the
business.</p>

<p>The clerk was taken on&mdash;and things began
to hum. Soon Austin and Black saw
other steps they ought to take. More attention
must be given to advertising. That
meant another clerk. Next came a bookkeeper,
an assistant bookkeeper.</p>

<p>Trade was increasing, you see, and net
profits were increasing. Extra clerks were
needed all right, but the proprietors went
the whole hog and put on so many that
they themselves no longer had to stand behind
a counter. They were both badly
bitten by the bug of supervision.</p>

<p>Finally the tide turned. It usually does.</p>

<p>And when Austin and Black went to the
bank one day to get an extension of credit,
the shrewd old retired farmer on the other
side of the desk laid down the law.</p>

<p>They got the extension&mdash;but only on certain
conditions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>The chief condition was that they do
LESS MANAGING and MORE MERCHANDISING.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 606px;">
<img src="images/illus102.jpg" width="606" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>And that's what they are doing today.</p>

<p>There were two managers who organized
their work, increased their profits. Up to
a certain point, every time they deputized<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
their work, it was an advantage, because it
left them more time for better merchandising.</p>

<p>But they weren't ORGANIZING according
to our TWO FUNDAMENTALS.
Literally, they were <i>deputizing all the work
that others could do</i>&mdash;and not confining the
work deputized to <i>work they themselves
could do only at the expense of something
more important</i>.</p>

<p>How well the chart tells the story! The
great big white piece of pie marked
"IDLE" shows exactly where Austin and
Black went wrong. The worst thing that
ever happened to them was the day they
went home from Chicago and tried to run
their business the way they thought Mr.
James W. Simpson runs his large retail
emporium.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the line they tripped
over the point of vanishing returns and
kept right on going.</p>

<p>And thus we come to the Scylla and
Charybdis of our job of ORGANIZING.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Remember we are not interested in the
mere knack of getting someone else to take
over every last responsibility that can be
borne by another. Perhaps that may be
good management for a Schwab&mdash;in so far,
at least, as it leaves his mind free for the
exercise of the broad judgment we mentioned
a while ago. Nor are we interested
in the sheer industry and application involved
in doing without assistance everything
that can possibly be so done, although
doing it may be equally good management
for, say, a file clerk. Rather is our interest
in the KNACK OF SENSING THE DIVIDING
LINE between WORK to PERFORM
and WORK to DEPUTIZE. It is
that ability which is the mark of the successful
manager.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Where is this DIVIDING LINE?
How shall we know where to DEPUTIZE
and when to PERFORM? What
kind of work shall we turn over to subor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>dinates?
What shall we reserve for ourselves?</p>

<p>Again, whatever the job or business we
are engaged in organizing, there are simple
rules to follow.</p>

<p>But first an illustration which will help
to make the point.</p>

<p>Consider the credit man for a large concern
which sold machines on a monthly
payment plan.</p>

<p>He was always in a jam with the sales
department. It took too long, complained
the sales manager, to get credit rulings. It
was no fun to put a whole lot of work into
selling the customer, only to have the order
turned down by the house because of poor
credit. Why couldn't the credit man give
them a ruling before they attempted to
close a sale? Sometimes it took so long to
get an O.K. that the prospect got all cold
and went somewhere else.</p>

<p>The treasurer of the company was drawn
into the picture when the sales manager
openly declared he'd "get" the credit man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>And it certainly looked as if the sales
manager had a good case.</p>

<p>"But," protested the credit man, "I've
made mighty few mistakes. As for delays&mdash;well,
I don't know how I could work any
harder."</p>

<p>"Maybe you work too hard," the treasurer
ventured.</p>

<p>"Hm, if I didn't do what I do, I don't
know who would."</p>

<p>"Hold on, now, let's get this thing
straight. You're valuable to the company
because of your long experience and good
judgment on credits. When you have all
the dope on a man, I'll bet my last dollar
on your decision. The only mistakes you
ever make are when you hurry your decisions.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;and here's the point&mdash;you aren't
any better at digging out the facts than
either of your two assistants. Yet here's
what you do. You divide salesmen's requests
for credit rulings into two groups.
You take those that run over $500; your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
assistants get the others. Each of you does
his own investigating and digging&mdash;and except
in puzzling cases, you practically let
your two men make their own decisions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus107.jpg" width="600" height="604" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Why, listen. You, the best man we
have on <i>decisions</i>, spend more than half
your time <i>digging</i>, while your assistants<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
spend much of their time making decisions.
What's the result? Delay, the department
in a jam, some decisions made in a hurry,
some by your assistants.</p>

<p>"The trouble with you is, you haven't
organized your department right." And
the treasurer sketched the diagram reproduced
in the upper chart on <a href="#Page_105">page 105</a>.</p>

<p>"Why, man, your job is to keep <i>all</i> bad
credits off the books&mdash;not just the big ones.
A bad risk&mdash;whether it's $5 or $5000&mdash;is a
mistake. You're an expert credit man&mdash;but
as a MANAGER, you're a WASHOUT.</p>

<p>"This," he added, "is the way you ought
to set up your department. Then you, the
best man on decisions, will do all the deciding.
Your two assistants, who are just
as good as you are at digging, will spend
all their time getting you the facts." And
as he spoke he sketched in the lower chart.</p>

<p>The credit man had erred in the other
direction from the two retail merchants.
He wasn't doing <i>enough</i> managing. He was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
keeping too much work for himself. And
he was <i>deputizing the wrong kind of work</i>.</p>

<p>The merchants were deputizing work
they should have done themselves&mdash;the
general supervision of stocks, advertising
and sales did not require their undivided
attention&mdash;and the volume and profits of
the business wouldn't stand so much unproductive
expense.</p>

<p>Our credit man, on the other hand, was
doing work which others could very well do
for him&mdash;the time he spent on such work
should have been devoted to other and
more important responsibilities.</p>

<p>In the story of the credit man, however,
another fundamental of good organization
comes to light. Remember how the treasurer
classified the character of the work to
be done? Not only was the credit man trying
to do too much work, but even when he
<i>did</i> assign work to his assistants, he assigned
the wrong kind. He deputized, true
enough&mdash;but he erred in regard to the
KIND OF WORK HE DEPUTIZED. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
thought he could deputize small credits. It
didn't take the treasurer long to show him
that the amount made no difference&mdash;it was
the character of the work that required
consideration.</p>

<p>Plenty of managers make that same mistake.
They judge the importance of the
task by its physical bigness&mdash;or by the
amount of money involved&mdash;instead of deciding
according to the character of the
work.</p>

<p>Before work can be safely deputized,
then, it must be MORE INTELLIGENTLY
CLASSIFIED. And the key to
better classification is found by dividing the
job or business into two elements.</p>

<p>One is ENTERPRISE. The other is
ROUTINE.</p>

<p><i>Enterprise</i> is an arbitrary term which we
shall choose to indicate those factors of
work which involve the use of judgment,
initiative, experiment or speculation.</p>

<p><i>Routine</i> we shall apply to those factors
which follow settled precedents or rules or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
come within the range of known ability to
perform.</p>

<p>Analyze your own job with these two
terms in mind. The various duties you perform
will fall readily into one or the other
of the two classifications.</p>

<p>The things which come under the head
of routine you have a right to deputize if,
when you chart both classifications&mdash;in as
accurate a proportion as possible to the
capacities of the "principal" and the "deputies"&mdash;you
find you are not overloading
the business with unproductive management.
A simple rule of thumb works here
about as well as anything: Base the division
of work on how much or how little of the
routine the <i>principal</i> can afford to carry.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You may safely deputize only so long
as, by so doing, you leave yourself free
for the more important, more profitable decisions.</p>

<p>Don't forget for a moment, then&mdash;if you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
would organize effectively&mdash;that there is a
tremendous difference between enterprise
and routine work. Don't waste energy on
the one. DON'T DEPUTIZE THE
OTHER&mdash;unless you can effectively organize
a deputy's capacity for doing it, and
then only if it pays.</p>

<p>Don't be like the manager who got a
taste of the savings to be made through the
application of mechanical handling equipment.
He bought conveyors&mdash;and more
conveyors. He was DEPUTIZING the
handling job to machines. So far, so good.
But the first thing you know he had a 50-ft.
conveyor connecting two points in his
shipping room. It took one man to load it,
another to unload it. Previously one man
with a hand truck had moved the packages
very nicely, and had a lot of time left over
for other duties. And here he needed an
extra man&mdash;and owned a costly piece of
equipment to boot. Under such circumstances
the conveyor became very expensive
scenery&mdash;not nearly so nice to look at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
as Yellowstone Park or the Riviera&mdash;and
the money invested in it would have bought
a trip to either.</p>

<p>Thus all savings through deputization
don't pay. Many a machine will save time
and labor, but the interest on the investment,
and upkeep and the depreciation will
more than eat up the saving&mdash;UNLESS
THE TIME AND LABOR SAVED CAN
BE PROFITABLY TURNED TO SOMETHING
ELSE.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>No attempted exposition of the
KNACK OF ORGANIZING can be
complete without something more than
passing mention of a phase which may be all
too easily slid over or completed.</p>

<p>When work is deputized, the responsibility
of the manager does not end with the
act of deputization. It is the manager's
responsibility to see that the work is done
in the simplest and most effective manner.</p>

<p>A sales executive had allowed a bunch of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
call reports to accumulate. There were
several hundred of them. So he called in a
stenographer whose time was hanging
fairly heavily on her hands, and asked her
to put them into alphabetical order preparatory
to filing.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later he happened by
and was startled to see that she had covered
two desks with the call reports and seemed
to be making haste very slowly indeed.</p>

<p>She had made a pile for every last letter
in the alphabet. And every time she picked
up a report, she had to hunt for the proper
pile to put it in.</p>

<p>So he showed her how to sort first in five
major piles&mdash;A, B, C, D in one pile and
so on. And then to sort each pile again
into five piles, one for each letter&mdash;and
finally to sort each individual pile alphabetically.</p>

<p>It sounded like more handling. And perhaps
it was. But the job of classification
was greatly simplified. There was no more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
hunting for the missing pile. The work
proceeded quickly and accurately.</p>

<p>A rough illustration. He might have
gone a step further and deputized part of
the girl's task to a machine instead of to
the primitive system described. That is to
say, he might have seen that she was provided
with one of the preliminary filing
baskets which file clerks often use. Then
the task of sorting alphabetically could
have been done in a single handling of
each report.</p>

<p>But whatever the method he made available
for the girl's use, the illustration still
serves to indicate that the manager's responsibility
does not end when he turns a
job over to a subordinate. It remains his
care to see that the job is done by the most
effective method&mdash;not necessarily the
speediest, but the one which gets the best
results for the effort involved.</p>

<p>To find this "one best" method, industry
has evolved a complete technique of time
and motion study. And merely to hint at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
what may be accomplished by breaking
down an operation into its elementary
operations and observing the time required
to perform them, becomes part of our task
in setting down the ways and means of
organizing.</p>

<p>First we shall find that any job, simple
or complex, may be divided into three
parts: make ready, do and put away.</p>

<p>Shaving, for example. First we get
everything ready&mdash;razor, brush, shaving
cream, hot water. Then comes the actual
operation of shaving. And last, cleaning
up&mdash;rinsing the brush, wiping the razor,
and putting things back where they belong.</p>

<p>Perhaps you're in the same boat as the
old farmer who, approached by the subscription
salesman of an agricultural magazine,
allowed he wa'nt farmin' now half as
good as he knew how.</p>

<p>Or perhaps you already hold speed records
at giving your face the once-over.
But, you see, the whole point in studying
the job is not aimed at faster shaving, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
at simplifying the "make ready" and "put
away" phases of the operation.</p>

<p>For example, the next time you shave,
try picking up the tube of shaving cream
with one hand and unscrewing the cap
while you're wetting your brush with the
other. It will be awkward as the dickens
the first time you try it. But try it again
and again and again. It won't be long before
you'll be an expert at doing the job
that way. Finish up that part of the operation
by screwing the cap back on while you
are lathering your face with the right hand.
Does it require a stop watch to point out
the saving in time that you've made? Oh,
it won't be easy the first few times, but
before you know it, you'll have taught
yourself good work habits.</p>

<p>Take a simple job like the assembly of a
license bracket in an automobile factory.
An analysis of this operation (see "Micromotion
Technique," by F. J. Van Poppelen,
<i>Factory and Industrial Management</i>, Nov.,
1930) showed that the right hand was busy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
all the time, while the left did nothing most
of the time except hold the piece.</p>

<p>At the risk of getting too technical&mdash;for
after all we are interested, not so much in
the details, as in certain broad principles
of organizing the work&mdash;let us see how the
operation was performed.</p>

<p>First the operator assembled a number
of screws and leather washers by picking
up a screw with the left hand, a washer
with the right, putting them together and
laying the assembly aside. Then he picked
up a bracket with the left hand and a screw
and washer assembly with the right, placing
the screw through a slot in the bracket&mdash;continuing
to hold assembled pieces in
his left hand while the right was picking up
a flat washer and assembling it to the
screw; picking up lock washer, assembling
it to the screw; picking up acorn nut and
starting it on the screw; and finally picking
up an open-end wrench and tightening the
nut. Then he assembled screw, washers
and nut to the other side of the bracket,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
whereupon wrench and bracket were laid
aside, completing the cycle.</p>

<p>An analysis of these motions, by right
and left hands, is given in the table on
<a href="#Page_120">page 120</a>. It illustrates the important point
that the right hand was busy all the time,
but for a considerable part of the time
the left was doing nothing but holding the
piece.</p>

<p>On pages <a href="#Page_118">118</a> and <a href="#Page_119">119</a> are shown drawings
of the old and the new assembly methods.
Likewise, the lower table on <a href="#Page_120">page 120</a>
analyzes, by right and left hands, the motions
required by the new method. Note
first that fewer elements&mdash;17 as against 26&mdash;are
required. And note that both hands
are productively employed with shorter distances
to travel for stock and with decreased
effort.</p>

<p>The new set-up consists of a hardwood
block, shaped to fit one side of the bracket
when assembled, and nailed to the bench.
The open-end wrench was replaced by a
screw-driver with a socket wrench to fit the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
acorn nut, suspended on a spring in front
of the operator. The miscellaneous containers
for holding the small parts were replaced
by a supply of sheet-metal duplicate
trays, so that the various parts could be located
in the most convenient position.
(This arrangement was not used in the accompanying
illustrations because it obscured
the view.)</p>

<p>In a word, then, the number of elements
was decreased by one-third&mdash;and practically
all of the elements in the new method
require less time than the similar or corresponding
element in the old method. The
distance of travel for stock has been
shortened, parts are grasped more easily,
better and faster tools are provided, effort
is decreased, and both hands are productively
employed.</p>

<p>Need the imagination be stretched to the
breaking point to see how a job involving
the work not of one man, but of several,
may be similarly organized and similarly
improved?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>A second illustration will serve to show
the application to group work (see "Motion
Study Applied to Group Work," by
J. A. Piacitelli, <i>Factory and Industrial Management</i>,
April, 1931, page 626).</p>

<p>The operation studied here involved
cycles of approximately eleven seconds' duration,
performed by a group of seven men.
The material handled consisted of rolls of
roofing weighing about 50 lbs. each. Many
of the elements in the cycle were obviously
fatiguing. The rolls had to be lifted, during
transfers from one worker to another,
and rolled along a horizontal runway. The
trucker lifted the completed roll and placed
it on his truck. While the rate of production
was limited by process and speed of
equipment, the chance to cut cost and
fatigue prompted the study.</p>

<p>Examine the equipment layout before
the study was made (it is shown on
<a href="#Page_124">page 124</a>), and follow the operation. A roll of
roofing paper approximately 8 in. in diameter
and 36 in. long was wound about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
mandrel of a winding machine by one of
the workers. The roll was taken off and
passed to another worker who wrapped a
sheet of paper about it and pasted it in
place. When the roll was wrapped, he had
to lift the roll, turn and deposit it on the
runway. The next man inserted a bag of
nails, a can of cement and an instruction
sheet into the core of the roll. To do this,
he was forced to turn and bend almost to
floor level to get his supplies.</p>

<p>Next the roll was passed along to two
men who, from opposite sides of the runway,
placed protectors and muslin caps on
the ends of the roll. It was then rolled
along to another man who placed gummed
paper bands about the ends and pushed the
roll to the end of the runway where the
trucker placed it on a truck and wheeled it
into storage.</p>

<p>The movie camera, which is gradually
finding wider industrial use in the search
for the "one best" method, was used to
record the work of this group. It supplied
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
not only a photographic record of the working
place and surrounding conditions, but
also a simultaneous record of time and
method employed by each worker regardless
of speed. It was then possible to study
overlapping cycles and to analyze the
methods to the desired degree of accuracy&mdash;and
thus to transfer parts of the cycle of
one operator to that of another, thus effecting
a better distribution of work and shortening
the cycle of the person on whom the
production of the group depends&mdash;thereby
increasing the productivity of the entire
group.</p>

<p>These analyses showed immediately an
unequal distribution of work. Again, from
the equipment layout made after the study,
let us follow through and see what changes
were effected.</p>

<p>First the wrapper was freed from turning
and lifting the roll from his table by the
introduction of an elevator which lifted the
roll to an inclined runway. The roll then
moved from place to place by gravity when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
released by foot-operated trips. The pasting
problem was solved by using a trough
the length of the paper, open on the bottom
and equipped with squeegee lips like the
mucilage bottle on your desk. A pile of
wrapping paper with the far edges of the
sheets inserted under the trough supplied a
pasted sheet every time one was drawn toward
the operator. The trough was covered
with a hinged plate which permitted
the roll to pass over it to the elevator. It
was found, by eliminating the fatiguing
elements in this man's work and simplifying
his cycle of motions, that the time
would be so reduced that he could easily
take over the work of the man who placed
the cement and nails in the core of the roll.
The instruction sheet was placed in the roll
by the winder, who had ample time for this
additional task. The pile of sheets was
placed at his right under a date stamp so
that he could date each sheet and slip it
into the roll just before it stopped.</p>

<p>Simplifying the cycle of the men who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
placed the caps on the ends of the roll enabled
them to take over with ease the work
of the man who had placed the gummed-paper
bands around the ends. Thus each
man capped and banded his own end,
whereas formerly the bander had had to assume
an awkward and fatiguing position to
reach the far end. And last, by placing a
redesigned truck at the end of the incline,
the completed rolls landed in the truck, and
the trucker was able to care for two machines.</p>

<p>The method finally established was recorded
on instruction sheets, and the existing
premium was modified to provide additional
incentive. Although, as stated at the
outset, the rate of production was limited
by the machine, substantial savings resulted
from the study. Production has
been maintained with 4&frac12; men instead of
7; fatigue has been greatly lessened; cost
has been reduced about 26 per cent; average
earnings of the group have increased
about 19 per cent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the search for the "one best"
method becomes an important factor in organizing
the work.</p>

<p>We might go on and show how this group
work was organized in accordance with our
two fundamentals, but the purpose of introducing
this illustration and the one preceding
it was, after all, to show that the
<i>principal's</i> responsibility, after deputizing
work, ends only when he has shown the
<i>deputy</i> the most effective method of doing
it.</p>

<p>Besides, we must hasten on to the task
of handling the "help." We have seen
that the entire FABRIC OF MANAGING
rests upon the knack of ORGANIZING;
that organizing the work must be preceded
by PLANNING; and that planning must
be based upon ANALYSIS. And now, having
organized, we must learn how to handle
the "help"&mdash;which is a task met in every
job involving managing.</p>

<p>And what job, big or small, does not involve
MANAGING?</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<h2>Handling the "Help"</h2>


<p>There used to be a good old golden
rule of thumb that was plenty good
enough for the good old rule-of-thumb
days. It was: <i>If you would be fair, treat
all your men alike</i>.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact it wasn't a bad rule
in those halcyon days for man wanted then
but little here below.</p>

<p>And he got it.</p>

<p>Those were the days when a certain
plant of a certain electrical concern was
known affectionately among the employees
as "Siberia."</p>

<p>With good reason, too, for it was the
dreariest, bleakest place in winter you can
imagine. And a transfer to it was like
nothing so much as a sentence to Siberia.</p>

<p>Well, well, their plant today is as com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>fortable
a place to work in as you'll find
anywhere in the country; that concern today
sets a high standard of employer-employee
relationships; those same workers
who, thirty years ago, shivered at the bare
thought of pulling on their pants and trekking
over the barren wastes to "Siberia,"
are today comfortably retired on modest
pensions which don't do a thing but help
keep the wolf from the door.</p>

<p>Yet the management, in those days beyond
recall, would have shown you that <i>all
men were treated alike</i>.</p>

<p>Perhaps that was the trouble. Anyway,
if you asked the management today how to
handle "help," dollars to doughnuts the
answer would come closer to being: To be
fair, TREAT EVERY MAN DIFFERENTLY.</p>

<p>A suggestive statement&mdash;significant because
it is indicative of tremendous change
in the relationships of capital and labor, of
employer and employee.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Fifteen years ago a lad graduated from
an Eastern university. His folks were poor
but proud&mdash;as Mr. Alger used to say&mdash;but
managed to see Phil through. Phil had
made a good record in school&mdash;and some
good friends. Through one of them he got
a letter to Mr. H&mdash;, the head of an old
established firm of stockbrokers&mdash;and the
letter got him a job.</p>

<p>The job paid $5 a week. Even in those
days there wasn't much left over after carfare
and lunches had been deducted.</p>

<p>But Phil was "learning the bond business."
He wouldn't be worth even $5 a
week the first six months. After that,
maybe.</p>

<p>He stuck. Graduated from "running the
street" to a stool in the stock clerk's cage.
Came the New Year and Phil found an
extra dollar in his pay envelope. He asked
the cashier if there wasn't some mistake.
There wasn't.</p>

<p>Two days later he got a job in a factory
near his home at $12 a week. Told Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
H&mdash; he was leaving. Was offered $15 to
stay. Wouldn't.</p>

<p>Mr. H&mdash; confessed later that he had let
the most promising prospect in years slip
through his fingers. All&mdash;if you ask us&mdash;because
it was a fixed policy of the house
to treat all alike.</p>

<p>For years it had been doing just exactly
that. Each June it took on a new crop of
young men to "learn the business." Each
young man got $5 a week. No favorites.
But nine out of every ten came from prosperous,
even wealthy families. That $5 bill
was nothing in their young lives. Their
families were glad to have them work for
nothing, for they were getting an insight
into the investment business&mdash;and some
day, whether they became bond salesmen
or just plain manufacturers and solid bankers,
that knowledge would be worth its
weight in gold.</p>

<p>Phil was the tenth man. Mr. H&mdash; knew
well enough that he couldn't get by on $5<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
a week. <i>But there was the rule.</i> It
couldn't be broken.</p>

<p>No, we can't wind up by telling how
Phil did well in the pants factory, married
the boss's daughter and owns the business
today. That would be wandering far from
the truth. He couldn't "see" the boss'
daughter for one thing&mdash;and besides the
pants factory wasn't such a much.</p>

<p>No, you'll find Phil today doing a
bang-up job in an Ohio plant. It says
"General Manager" on his door. And as
far as he is concerned, it was the best thing
that ever happened when Mr. H&mdash; treated
him like all the rest.</p>

<p>Mr. H&mdash;, though, is still taking them on,
still paying them $5 a week&mdash;or maybe it's
$10&mdash;still treating them all alike. He gets
a lot of bright young fellows into the business.
But every so often he passes up a
chance to get an exceptionally promising
boy&mdash;because he is fair and treats them all
alike. What's a rule for, anyway, except<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
to break? Mr. H&mdash; will never know that
it's the <i>exception</i> that proves the rule&mdash;particularly
when you are dealing with human
values.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But more later of the newer viewpoint.
For the moment we are talking about
handling the "help"&mdash;and making it sound
as though it were solely the problem of the
big employer.</p>

<p>Not so. It is a problem with every one
of you in business&mdash;unless you do nothing
but sit in one spot and do one job from
nine to five, five days&mdash;we hope&mdash;a week.</p>

<p>The editor who wants a manuscript
typed; the salesman who must get long distance;
the man at the machine who has to
get tools from the toolroom; the errand
boy with his bundle to carry&mdash;all have the
same problem. To all of them it is just as
important in relation to their own scale of
things as it is to the manager of a business
with ten or a hundred or a thousand em<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>ployees.
It is the eternal problem of GETTING
OTHERS TO COOPERATE.</p>

<p>Some men are good at it; others are total
failures.</p>

<p>Many a man on the bench or at the machine
has the ability, knowledge and experience
which qualify him for a job as
foreman or even superintendent. But he
can't hold down a foreman's job because
he hasn't the knack of getting hearty,
whole-souled cooperation from others.</p>

<p>Foremen, too, have changed, you see.
Today the successful foreman is less often
the hard-boiled driver, more often the
student of his job, of his men, of himself.
He has learned that, <i>to be fair, he must
treat every man differently</i>.</p>

<p>Often we hear of Bill's losing his job as
a mechanic, not because he didn't know
his job, not because he couldn't run every
lathe in the shop, but because he "couldn't
get along" with the other men. And we
think, Poor Bill! it's too bad he's so quick-tempered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Generally we blame it on "temperament."
Yet some of the very best handlers
of men are the crabbiest, crankiest gents
in seven states. Others are as cold as steel.
And like as not the warm-hearted, generous
man is a monumental failure at handling
his "help."</p>

<p>No, when you check specific methods of
handling people&mdash;methods which are successful
for the most part&mdash;something much
more fundamental than temperament will
be found.</p>

<hr style="width: 40%;" />

<p>Mrs. Thompson was in charge of the information
desk and switchboard in a medium-sized
New England factory. A well-bred
Englishwoman in her late thirties, the
boss liked her for her pleasant voice over
the phone, for her unfailingly courteous
treatment of visitors.</p>

<p>But if the boss liked her, almost no one
else did. Salesmen particularly complained
of her crankiness and of the unsatisfactory<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
service they got. Young Bacon was an
exception, though. He always got what he
wanted.</p>

<p>One day the office manager asked him
how on earth he did it.</p>

<p>Bacon thought he was being taken for a
ride, but finally answered: "Why, that's a
cinch. I take Mrs. Thompson's job seriously."</p>

<p>Pressed for details, he supplied them.</p>

<p>"I never try to kid her. I never bawl
her out. When I want a number I treat her
as though the switchboard were her own
particular business and I a customer. Just
as if she had something to sell, and I something
to buy. When I ask for some special
service, she gives it to me. Or she tells me
why she can't."</p>

<p>Afterwards the office manager took the
trouble to look into the situation. The
switchboard job was a life saver to that
woman of 38. She needed the money in
the first place. And besides the job gave
her a sense of responsibility. She was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
proud of her job, proud to know that the
men in the business depended upon her for
certain important services. She couldn't
understand, then, when a salesman picked
up his telephone and barked a command at
her as though she were a piece of office
furniture, or patronized her as if she were a
child, or kidded her as if she were a 20-year-old
flapper. It made her cranky to be
treated like that. And when someone like
Bacon came along with his method of treating
her work as a responsible piece of business,
it put her on her mettle.</p>

<p>The solution was obvious. The office
manager talked Mrs. Thompson and Mrs.
Thompson's job over with the salesmen. It
wasn't long before they changed their tactics,
with resultant improvement in the
quality of the telephone service they got.</p>

<p>Sounds like a case of knowing the foibles
of the person involved, doesn't it?</p>

<p>It's more than that.</p>

<p>Edna is a switchboard operator, too. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
is pretty and agreeable. And you couldn't
blame the boys for liking to hang around.</p>

<p>No one thought much about that until
some of the more serious-minded men discovered
they couldn't get a thing out of
Edna. She was too busy listening to Joe's
latest exploit with one hand, and plugging
Jack in with the other. She played favorites
in putting through long distance calls,
took advantage of the friendly feeling
everyone had toward her. The telephone
service in that office just folded up and
died. There wasn't any.</p>

<p>The obvious remedy was to fire Edna.
But the manager was a cagey old codger.
Beneath a rough exterior beat a heart of
gold, and somehow he felt that maybe it
wasn't all Edna's fault. Why, blast it,
she'd been treated like a pretty, petulant
girl. Why shouldn't she act like one?</p>

<p>A memo was the result. It announced
the creation of a new department. "Telephone
Service" was its name&mdash;and Edna
Blank was its head. It was just as much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
a part of the business as the accounting department,
or any other.</p>

<p>He had sense enough to PUT DEFINITE
RESPONSIBILITIES UPON
EDNA'S SHOULDERS. He did it not
only to instill in her a sense of duty, but
also to impress her with his confidence in
her ability to perform those duties. Then,
under the rose, he instructed the men to
treat her just as they treated the capable
woman in charge of the accounting end of
the business. They did. And Edna rose to
the occasion, took pride in her work, discouraged
the hangers-on, played no favorites
in putting through calls, and became
as good an operator as ever you'd hope
to see.</p>

<p>Now, then, scratch the surface and what
do you find? Not that it was simply a
case of understanding Mrs. Thompson's
and Edna's foibles. Not at all. Mrs.
Thompson stopped being cranky and became
accommodating, Edna dropped her
irresponsible ways and became an alert, at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>tentive
operator WHEN THEY GOT
THE FEELING OUT OF THEIR WORK
THAT THEY WERE TRANSACTING
BUSINESS FOR THEMSELVES.</p>

<p>And need we look for further proof of
our postulate that TO BE FAIR, YOU
MUST TREAT ALL YOUR ASSISTANTS
DIFFERENTLY? You must know
them, know yourself, if you would get
whole-hearted cooperation. That is fundamental
in any attempt to acquire the
KNACK OF HANDLING THE "HELP."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For there <i>is</i> a KNACK of handling the
help. It <i>can</i> be acquired. This we say
despite the difficulty of analyzing the relations
of one person to another, despite the
seeming impossibility of setting down a rule
which will work universally.</p>

<p>Take a man running a peanut stand, a
hosiery mill, or a steel plant. There are
three things he wants for himself: (1) to
build up and hold a good trade; (2) to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
please his customers; (3) to get a fair
profit.</p>

<p>Remember these three wants when you're
dealing with your help.</p>

<p>Get your "help"&mdash;it may be the switchboard
operator or it may be a thousand
automobile workmen&mdash;in the position of
wanting those same three things. The
help's job is his "trade," you are his customer;
and his compensation is his profit.</p>

<p>When you do that, you have an employee
or helper who is going to give you the
hearty cooperation you're looking for&mdash;just
so long as you are a good customer, and his
compensation for helping you is a fair
profit.</p>

<p>Next time you go into a store, try to
keep that thought fixed in your mind.
Everyone working in a business, you see,
is selling his services&mdash;and when you use
those services you are the buyer. Perhaps
you pay in money for the services rendered&mdash;perhaps
you simply repay him by mak<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>ing
his day's work easier. In either event,
treat your requests for service as though
you and he were transacting a business that
is mutually, but individually, profitable,
and the cooperation which is otherwise
usually begrudged will be automatically
forthcoming.</p>

<p>But that, you say, is PERSONALITY.
Then how do you account for this?</p>

<p>A. is a big, breezy salesman. He busts
into a hotel, calls the "greeter" behind the
desk by name, asks for 1209 "same as last
time"&mdash;and gets all kinds of real service
from porters, bell-hops and waiters.</p>

<p>It looks as though it might be personality.</p>

<p>Yet right behind him walks B. He's a
horse-faced bird who never smiles&mdash;wiry,
monosyllabic&mdash;asks brusquely for a $4
room&mdash;gets it. And gets everything else
he asks for&mdash;just as promptly as A. does.</p>

<p>No, it can't be personality. For there's
C. and there's D. C. is A's twin&mdash;and B.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
and D. were cast in the same mold. Their
tips are no smaller; their demands no more
unreasonable. Yet C. gets the poorest sample
room in the house. And D's trunk is
always the last one the porter brings up.</p>

<p>These aren't exaggerated cases. Hotel
men will tell you they happen every day.</p>

<p>Why, then, did A. and B. rate such good
service while their fellow knights of the
road got none? Because when A. and B.
asked for something, there was about the
transaction a well-defined air of "you've
something you can do for me&mdash;I've something
I want done&mdash;what say we trade?"
Whereas, when C. and D. came along, regardless
of the personal manners involved,
there was created the atmosphere of a one-sided
business deal. C's breeziness had in
it a touch of condescension, or D's brusqueness
was the brusqueness of assumed superiority.</p>

<p>Thus is it seen, when we forget all about
personality and study effects, that coop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>eration
is gained by trading with the "help"
according to the "help's" business.</p>

<p>Trade with an elevator man as though
running an elevator were his own business&mdash;trade
with the chief chemist as though
the laboratory were his store&mdash;and they'll
trade with you and be eager to make a
satisfactory deal of it.</p>

<p>Under this fixed policy&mdash;or rule&mdash;the
proper attitude to take towards this or that
class of "help" becomes a matter of automatic
selection.</p>

<p>And that is how we begin to acquire the
KNACK OF HANDLING THE HELP.
Thus do we step high, wide and handsome
on our road to the KNACK OF MANAGING.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now enters the business of COMPENSATION.
There must be compensation
in a trade if all hands are to be satisfied.</p>

<p>Everyone is in business because he wants<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
something. Everything that will help him
to get what he wants, he will like to do;
everything that hinders him, he will dislike
to do.</p>

<p>When you get ready to "trade" with
someone, therefore, consider what the other
man wants&mdash;that is, if you want to get the
most help or cooperation out of the transaction.
Then consider what you can give
in return&mdash;balancing his wants.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/illus148.jpg" width="640" height="335" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>There must be that balance in every satisfactory
deal.</p>

<p>Examine the chart on this page. It will
save a lot of paper and ink because it shows
diagrammatically what must happen if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
there are to be satisfactory arrangements
between you and your "help".</p>

<p>A word or two by way of interpretation
may serve to show how it works out.</p>

<p>When the "help" is in your employ, the
compensation&mdash;what you can give and he
can take, leaving both parties satisfied&mdash;is
his monthly pay check or his weekly envelope.
Or it is the rate of commission.
And bearing upon it are such things as local
living conditions, and so on. When the
"help" is someone not in your direct employ,
then the compensation is regulated by
the effect which performing the service you
require, has on the success of the "help's"
regular day's work.</p>

<p>For the moment, let's us return to the
messenger boy whom we left in Chapter
III just as he was about to deliver a message.</p>

<p>Or, at least, let's talk about another messenger
boy whose task of managing his job
differs in no wise from the first's&mdash;or, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
that matter, from any other job of management.</p>

<p>This boy worked in a large Chicago
building and his job was carting light but
bulky packages back and forth between his
company's quarters and its customers'.
There were a dozen other boys, and most
of them complained of having trouble getting
up and down in the elevators. It
seemed that the starter took delight in making
the boys wait for the freight elevator&mdash;even
when there was plenty of room in
the others.</p>

<p>But this particular boy&mdash;an impudent
youngster with a "fresh" way about him&mdash;had
no trouble at all. So the office
manager was anxious to know "how come."</p>

<p>He posted himself where he could
observe without being seen. And sure
enough, in came the fresh messenger boy
with a bundle almost as big as himself.
Down he set it, favored the starter with
an impudent military salute and leaned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
nonchalantly up against the wall&mdash;well out
of the way.</p>

<p>"Hello, feller," said he breezily; "lemme
know when there's room. And don't keep
me waiting too long, or I'll be out on my
ear."</p>

<p>Picture the manager's astonishment when
the starter replied:</p>

<p>"Git in here, then, and git in quick," and
let him in the first car going up.</p>

<p>Somewhere, somehow, that impudent
youngster had struck a responsive chord.
Instinctively&mdash;or else because of past experience
with elevator starters&mdash;he had put
the problem of that particular starter's
service on a business basis. He had put it
in the starter's power to perform his own
work without trouble, and to feel at the
same time that he was "a man of affairs."</p>

<p>He was able to show his authority without
taking it out on the boy.</p>

<p>Analyze this "trade" with the "compensation"
chart in mind. Do you not see the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
"balance" of interests? Do you not see
the starter's feeling that the service he rendered
was his own business, that the boy
was one of his customers, that the avoidance
of trouble was his compensation or
profit?</p>

<p>Is there not in this very unimportant
transaction the BALANCE OF INTERESTS
suggested by our little chart?</p>


<p>At this stage of our approach to the
KNACK OF MANAGEMENT, a
ready objection comes to mind. We are now
dealing in human values and relationships&mdash;and
you can't chart them. Analysis, planning,
organization&mdash;certain rules may be
set down which will enable one to attain
some degree of effectiveness in carrying
them out.</p>

<p>But human nature? You can't deal with
it by rule.</p>

<p>The objection is well founded. You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
can't chart human nature&mdash;but you <i>can</i>
study the approaches to it and chart the
laws that appeal to it.</p>

<p>Our chart on <a href="#Page_146">page 146</a> is based upon what
successful managers have learned about
finding the wants of the human element
when it works, and is constructed to supply
a method of supplying those wants with as
much productiveness and as little friction
as possible.</p>

<p>When you buy a new car and "put it to
work," your first care is to find out its
wants&mdash;how much you must give to get
what it has to "sell"&mdash;what parts need oil
and grease and so on.</p>

<p>So, IF YOU WANT TO GET WORK
OUT OF A HUMAN BEING, your best
bet is to find out what that human being
needs and must get in return for the work
he performs or the service he gives.</p>

<p>Some men seem to be born with an instinct
for finding this out. But if you
aren't built that way, there is no reason<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
why you can't drill yourself to the same
end by deliberately studying each case.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>See, for example, how a study of this sort
gets the most out of men in a large New
England plant where modern management
methods are making serious inroads into
the old rule-of-thumb ways of doing things.</p>

<p>This concern was confronted with the
very serious problem of maintaining a
steady flow of product from one manufacturing
department to another. Because
of the nature of the product, skids and
power trucks had been chosen as the equipment
best suited for the job.</p>

<p>Skids and lift trucks are effective handling
units. No argument about that.
Their introduction into any factory which
has been using more primitive handling
methods should automatically cut costs.
But they save precious little time and
money when they aren't working, or when
they are being worked uneconomically.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>The problem, then, as this concern saw
it, was how to be sure that Big Ed hadn't
shipped off for a quiet smoke far from the
maddening crowd&mdash;or that Little Joe
wasn't arranging his work so that there'd
be a handful of skids left over at closing
time&mdash;moves that called for overtime pay.</p>

<p>In other words, to get 100 per cent efficiency
out of very efficient handling equipment,
the management realized that it must
take out some sort of insurance which
would guarantee Little Joe's and Big Ed's
and all the other truckers' being engaged
in gainful occupation eight hours&mdash;count
'em&mdash;each and every day.</p>

<p>The best insurance seemed to be a central
dispatching system. No need to go
into the details of its operation. Suffice
it to say that it went a long way toward
directing the efforts of the truckers along
gainful lines. There came to be an orderliness
which had never existed before.
When a foreman put in a call for a trucker,
he knew that the move would be made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
without unnecessary delay. In fact, orders
were placed into the truckers' hands within
three minutes of the time the foreman
picked up his telephone to call the central
dispatching department.</p>

<p>BUT&mdash;no attempt had been made to sell
this system to the truckers. It met with
some little resistance, just as anything new
does. And there are ways, as who does
not know, of beating any "game" designed
to get more work out of human beings.</p>

<p>So the management&mdash;after many a huddle
over this particular situation&mdash;decided
upon a bonus plan.</p>

<p>And they set about selling it to the
truckers&mdash;somewhat in the fashion about to
be narrated.</p>

<p>"See here, men," said the manager in
effect, "I'm going to put this plan right
up to you and let you decide for yourselves.
We've looked into it carefully.
You men average 30 moves a day. So
we've chosen 40 moves as the starting
point. We're sure you can make 40 moves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
a day without tearing your shirts&mdash;and
from there on, you begin to collect. For
the next five trips you get a bonus of a
nickel over and above your day rate; for
the next five trips your bonus is 6 cents;
and so on.</p>

<p>"So, if a man makes 50 trips, his day's
pay is not $4.50, but $5.05 because he has
earned 55 cents in bonus. Do you get it?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, we get it all right, all right. We
do twice as much work for 50 or 60 cents
more a day. How come? Why don't we
get paid extra for <i>all</i> the moves we make
over 30?"</p>

<p>"Because we're just like you. The company
wants to make more money. We've
shown you how it can be done and we'll
split pretty much 50-50. But we won't
give you all the extra profit any more than
we'd think of keeping it ourselves. Now
think it over tonight and if you want to
make $5 or $5.50 a day instead of $4.50,
come 'round in the morning and we'll talk
some more about it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>Came only the dawn.</p>

<p>The truckers were pretty sure that they
were being had, although they couldn't
figure out just how. 'Tis ever thus when
the old order yields place to new.</p>

<p>There was nothing left to do but try a
new tack. So the manager talked to his
fifteen or eighteen truckers again. And
this time he proposed taking two of them
and putting them on the new plan. After
a little conversation to assure themselves
that there was no skullduggery afoot, the
truckers consented. And Little Ed and Big
Joe (sic!) were nominated.</p>

<p>Little Ed made 62 moves the very first
day and was as fresh as a daisy when the
5 o'clock whistle blew. Big Joe made 56
trips and looked none the worse for it.
Ed's bonus was $1.98; Joe's was $1.28.
If you check up, we're sure you'll find those
figures are wrong. But cheer up, we aren't
nearly so much interested in the exact
amounts of Ed's and Joe's earning as we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
are in the ultimate results and in the principles
involved.</p>

<p>We may pass quickly over the former.
Of course the men were convinced. And
Big Ed would have beaten any trucker to
a gentle pulp who wouldn't have been convinced.
In a week's time, those truckers
were making nearly twice as many trips a
day&mdash;and their earnings had increased by
something like 35 per cent.</p>

<p>If you don't believe it, look at the figure
on <a href="#Page_158">page 158</a>. See what happened to production?
Yes, that pretty dotted line&mdash;the
one with the big dip in it&mdash;marks labor
costs per trip.</p>

<p>The manager, you see&mdash;and now we
come to the principle involved&mdash;had
MADE HIS HELP SEE THAT THE
BONUS PLAN AMOUNTED TO GIVING
THEM WHAT THEY WANTED.
And of course, that was more pay. At the
same time it got the company what it
wanted&mdash;more production.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, the manager's system<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
was precisely like the messenger boy's.
And you can prove that in a trice by charting
it on the same old basis.</p>

<p>Try it. It won't take you more than a
couple of minutes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This might go on for a long, long time.
Innumerable examples might be introduced
into this text to illustrate this balancing
of wants and its importance to the
successful conduct of this business of MANAGING&mdash;to
illustrate that your own
personal method of seeking cooperation or
service is more a matter of reason than innate
ability to "size up the other fellow."</p>

<p>There is, in a word, method back of this
"KNACK OF HANDLING THE HELP."</p>

<p>The method is this. Ask yourself each
time this simple question: What does your
"helper" want?</p>

<p>Does your stenographer want to leave
promptly at five so she can get ready for
an evening of whoopee? Or does she have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
to catch a particular train in order not to
find a cold supper waiting for her at home?
Then why not fix things so she can work
during the hours she is paid to work&mdash;and
so she can leave at the hour when pay
stops?</p>

<p>Can your truckers live in the style to
which they are accustomed on $4.50 a day?
Or will $5.50 enable them to put away a
bit for a rainy season? Then why not
arrange a wage payment method which will
help them to do it?</p>

<p>And above all, tell them WHY.</p>

<p>To do such things is not philanthropy.
Successful managers will tell you IT IS
NOTHING MORE NOR LESS THAN
GOOD BUSINESS. Strip from their
methods the individual characteristics required
by the individual conditions involved.
What do you find? EVERY
LAST ONE OF THEM IS BASED ON
OUR PRIMARY RULE. That, you remember,
is to find out what you want from
your "help" and what your "help" wants<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
from you; then a way to make the two
meet on a ground of mutual satisfaction&mdash;the
compensation you can give and the
compensation they can take&mdash;and BOTH
OF YOU GET WHAT YOU WANT.</p>

<p>Don't you see, to grasp the real KNACK
OF HANDLING "HELP," the necessity
for making what you want from them balance
with what they want from you? If
there isn't that balance, there won't be
whole-souled COOPERATION. To paraphrase
what Henry Ford once said&mdash;or
what one of his collaborators made him
say: "See that each man in doing the best
he can for you is also doing the best he can
for himself."</p>

<p>Thus, by digging in and finding out what
everybody involved in the situation wants,
it is possible to get the utmost in cooperation
and loyalty. Where one man does so
instinctively, another gets equally good results
by making a deliberate study along
the lines we have pointed out.</p>

<p>Hundreds of jobs don't get done<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
promptly and enthusiastically for no other
reason than that they aren't interesting.
They can be made interesting if you get
the right line on what your work requires,
what your "help" wants, and then make a
common meeting ground.</p>

<p>Mark Twain knew all about the KNACK
OF MAKING WORK INTERESTING
AND ATTRACTIVE.</p>

<p>Remember his description of Tom Sawyer's
whitewashing the fence? Even if you
do, it won't hurt to read it again.</p>

<p>Poor Tom. It was on a summer's morn
just made for swimming or fishing&mdash;and he
had to work.</p>

<p>Along comes Ben, one of his cronies.
Tom begins to do some tall thinking. But
let's not try to improve the original:</p>

<p>"He took up his brush and went tranquilly
to work....</p>

<p>"Ben said: 'Hello, old chap, you got to
work, hey?'</p>

<p>"Tom wheeled suddenly and said: 'Why,
it's you, Ben! I warn't noticing.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Say&mdash;I'm going in a-swimming, I am.
Don't you wish you could? But of course
you'd ruther <i>work</i>&mdash;wouldn't you? Course
you would!'</p>

<p>"Tom contemplated the boy a bit, and
said: 'What do you call work?'</p>

<p>"'Why, ain't that work?'</p>

<p>"Tom resumed his whitewashing, and
answered carelessly: 'Well, maybe it is, and
maybe it ain't. All I know is, it suits Tom
Sawyer.'</p>

<p>"'Oh come, now, you don't mean to let
on you like it?'</p>

<p>"The brush continued to move.</p>

<p>"'Like it? Well, I don't see why I
oughtn't to like it. Does a boy get a
chance to whitewash a fence every day?'</p>

<p>"That put the thing in a new light. Ben
stopped nibbling his apple. Tom swept his
brush daintily back and forth&mdash;stepped
back to note the effect&mdash;added a touch here
and there&mdash;criticized the effect again&mdash;Ben
watching every move and getting more and
more interested, more and more absorbed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>"Presently he said: 'Say, Tom, let <i>me</i>
whitewash a little.'</p>

<p>"Tom considered, was about to consent;
but he altered his mind. 'No, no&mdash;I reckon
it wouldn't hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt
Polly's awful particular about this fence&mdash;right
here on the street&mdash;you know&mdash;but
if it was the back fence I wouldn't mind
and she wouldn't. Yes, she's awful particular
about this fence; it's got to be done
very careful; I reckon there ain't one boy
in a thousand, mebbe two thousand, that
can do it the way it's got to be done.'</p>

<p>"'No&mdash;is that so? Oh, come now&mdash;lemme
just try. Only just a little&mdash;I'd let
you, if you was me, Tom.'</p>

<p>"'Ben, I'd like to, honest Injun; but
Aunt Polly&mdash;well, Jim wanted to do it, but
she wouldn't let him; Sid wanted to do it,
and she wouldn't let Sid. Now don't you
see how I'm fixed? If you was to tackle
this fence and anything was to happen to
it&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Oh, shucks, I'll be just as careful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Now lemme try. Say&mdash;I'll give you the
core of my apple.'</p>

<p>"'Well, here&mdash;no, Ben, now don't. I'm
afeard&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'I'll give you all of it!'</p>

<p>"Tom gave up the brush with reluctance
in his face, but alacrity in his heart. And
while the late Steamer Big Missouri worked
and sweated in the sun, the retired artist
sat on a barrel in the shade close by, dangled
his legs, munched his apple, and
planned the slaughter of more innocents.
There was no lack of material; boys happened
along every little while; they came
to jeer, but remained to whitewash. By
the time Ben was fagged out, Tom had
traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for
a kite, in good repair; and when he played
out, Johnny Miller bought in for a dead
rat and a string to swing it with&mdash;and so
on, and so on, hour after hour. And when
the middle of the afternoon came, from being
a poor poverty-stricken boy in the
morning, Tom was literally rolling in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
wealth. He had, besides the things before
mentioned, twelve marbles, part of a jew's-harp,
a piece of blue bottle glass to look
through, a spool cannon, a key that
wouldn't unlock anything, a fragment of
chalk, a glass stopper of a decanter, a tin
soldier, a couple of tadpoles, six firecrackers,
a kitten with only one eye, a brass
doorknob, a dog collar&mdash;but no dog&mdash;the
handle of a knife, four pieces of orange
peel and a dilapidated old window sash.</p>

<p>"He had a nice, good, idle time all the
while&mdash;plenty of company&mdash;and the fence
had three coats of whitewash on it! If he
hadn't run out of whitewash, he would have
bankrupted every boy in the village."</p>

<p>Mark Twain didn't have the worker on
the modern assembly line in mind&mdash;nor the
stenographer tapping her typewriter&mdash;but
he <i>did</i> see that THE WORK MEN CAN
DO BEST IS THE WORK THAT IS
MADE ATTRACTIVE TO THEM&mdash;either
through the money in it or the sheer
success in doing it. Find out what's wanted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
to make your work attractive, then find
out what you can give that will meet those
wants. Then you get not only good work,
but loyalty in it and enthusiasm for it.</p>

<p>But you can't fool your "help"&mdash;at least
not for long. If you play upon the desire
for responsibility, you must give it up to
capacity. If it is promotion you hold out
as a reward, you must give it when it is
deserved. If you play upon the desire for
good pay, you must give it as far as the
job will allow.</p>

<p>And the nearer you come to giving all
you can afford for the service received, in
as nearly as possible the form that is
wanted, whether in courtesy or in coin, in
reasonable hours or in rapid advancement,
in self-respect or in reciprocal service, THE
MORE COOPERATION YOU MAY
EXPECT.</p>

<h2>Safeguarding the
Business</h2>


<p>Now for the last lap. Our journey has
run four-fifths of its course. We
have passed through the successive stages
of analysis, planning, organization and handling
the "help." They have all been
child's play compared with the most important
part of the manager's work&mdash;the
task of GUARDING THE WELFARE OF
A BUSINESS OR A JOB. All other managerial
cares fade into insignificance before
the necessity of conserving the general good
of the business.</p>

<p>A business rises. A business falls. Its
life must be protected. And, as has been
said so often, "the bigger they are, the
harder they fall."</p>

<p>A certain concern in New York State
had been enjoying prosperity for lo! these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
many years. Established 'way back in the
"Roaring Forties," it had passed through
three generations of the same family.</p>

<p>Each morning at nine the president was
at his desk opening the mail into three piles&mdash;taking
great care that no checks fell into
the waste basket&mdash;as might easily have
happened had the task been delegated to
the office manager or to his assistant.</p>

<p>It was unfortunate, of course, that no
orders reached the stockroom until ten
o'clock. But a president must earn his
salt. Besides, is there a better way to keep
one's finger on the pulse of the business
than to know what's in the mail?</p>

<p>Let's take a look at those three piles,
though. Here is the daily "take"&mdash;a fat
pile of checks&mdash;with the big one from San
Francisco laid carefully aside so that it can
be admired a couple of extra times before
being placed on the top of the heap.</p>

<p>Reverently the president carries the receipts
to his head bookkeeper. With slow
and majestic tread, almost.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>And over here are the orders.</p>

<p>It's a fat pile, too.</p>

<p>The president casts one last lingering
glance at the &frac12; doz. of something or other
ordered by a famous name&mdash;and, secure in
the knowledge that Fifth Avenue shoppers
are still clamoring for his product, hands
the sheaf to his office manager who has been
pretty fidgety for the past hour and a half
because he knows the stock department is
going to have a heck of a time making the
afternoon express.</p>

<p>Ho, hum! It's a busy life, this being
the president of a successful concern doing
over a million a year. Why, when grandfather
started in, he didn't have a&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But that's another story, and there's that
third pile.</p>

<p>A slim little pile scarcely demanding a
president's attention&mdash;or a sales manager's.
A few complaints. A retailer out in Butte.
That San Antonio jobber Winchester had
such a hard time landing. What's this?
Didn't get the buttons he ordered? Stuff<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
and nonsense&mdash;well, Henry will write nice,
consoling letters and those will be those.</p>

<p>Now Henry is a good kid. Just out of
school. Learning the business. Writes a
bang-up letter.</p>

<p>But the San Antonio jobber doesn't want
nice, consoling letters. He wants to know
how come his pants came without the special
buttons he ordered. And those special
buttons are so important in his life that he
has written to the head of the firm&mdash;whom
he'd met at the Atlantic City convention&mdash;and
he expects the head of the firm to
tell him what he wants to know.</p>

<p>"Come, come," the president would have
said to him, had he walked into the inner
sanctum, "you know I can't give my time
to such petty details&mdash;I've got department
heads who attend to such matters. When
you want an extra thirty days&mdash;or want to
talk over handling our goods exclusively in
the Southwest&mdash;why, those are the things
for you and me to spend our time on."</p>

<p>But the San Antonio jobber, had he been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
there, and had he been asked, would have
rejoined:</p>

<p>"I, too, have my department heads. I,
too, leave many of the trivial details to
them. But if a customer came to me with
a complaint, I wouldn't care a rap what it
was about. It wouldn't be that particular
complaint which would interest me. It
would be the mere fact that he had a complaint
at all. A dissatisfied customer is a
dissatisfied customer, and there isn't anything
in my business that would get quicker
and more personal attention from me."</p>

<p>Well, well, businesses come and businesses
go. Our imaginary conversation will
never take place between the president and
the San Antonio jobber. The San Antonio
jobber took his business elsewhere some five
years ago. The president still comes in at
nine and opens the mail. He never drops
a check in the wastebasket. There are still
three piles in front of him. Three slim
piles. Even the pile of complaints is slim.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
There isn't enough business left to produce
many complaints.</p>

<p>Henry? Oh, he got to writing letters
to an heiress who was wintering on the
Riviera. And when her daddy died, he
wrote such a nice, consoling letter&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But we wander far afield. We're out
in the rough somewhere, and it's going to
take a real recovery to get us back on the
fairway if we don't watch out.</p>

<p>For one thing and for instance: <i>Is</i> the
customer always right?</p>

<p>A one-time shoe salesman reports the following
incident in a Chicago department
store. He was talking with the head buyer
in the middle of the sales floor when up
marched a thoroughly angry woman with
the shoe adjuster tagging on behind.</p>

<p>"These shoes," she pointed to a pair of
satin pumps in the adjuster's hands, "are
too small."</p>

<p>"And she wants a new pair after having
worn them half a dozen times," added the
adjuster.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who sold them?" asked the buyer.</p>

<p>"Jones."</p>

<p>"Go get him."</p>

<p>Came Jones. "But, madam," he protested,
"don't you remember I warned you
that you needed a 5&frac12;? And don't you remember
that I also suggested an A instead
of a double A? And when you felt certain
you wanted the 5AA, didn't I suggest that
you try them again at home before having
the cut-steel buckles sewn on?"</p>

<p>Well, yes, that was all quite true. But
it didn't offset the fact that the shoes were
too small and she couldn't wear them.</p>

<p>Two guesses as to what she got. And
if each guess is a satin pump you may step
quickly and quietly to the head of the class.
She got a new pair of shoes.</p>

<p>"Well," sighed the buyer, when peace
and quiet had been once more restored,
"they tell me upstairs the customer is always
right. Certainly it's true that one
dissatisfied woman has more effect on our
business than four or five satisfied cus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>tomers.
Oh, no, she won't go and tell her
friends about the fair treatment she got
here, but oh, man, if we'd let her get away!
What a story that would have been&mdash;in
spite of admitting she was wrong!"</p>

<p>Innumerable examples of that sort of
thing might be introduced. There is the
story of the North Shore matron who had
an expensive rug sent out, kept it three
months and then decided she didn't like the
color. In its place she wanted a certain
oriental, but oh, dear, it was just a bit too
big for her purpose.</p>

<p>Of course the rug was cut to fit. And
when she decided a week later that it, too,
wouldn't do and went and bought another
rug somewhere else, the management
thanked her kindly and credited her account
with the full amount. It knew that
the life of the business had to be protected,
and every now and then found it distinctly
worth while to take time out to LOOK
AFTER THE WELFARE OF THE
ENTERPRISE.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>And here we face another question:
"Must the manager occupy his time with
every minor complaint, just because it happens
to be one which comes from a good
customer?"</p>

<p>To answer it, we must go back to our
New York State manufacturer and strip
the scenery from his particular enterprise.</p>

<p>His is a business of few customers. Except
for a half-dozen famous retailers whose
accounts cost more than they earn, but to
whose stores he may point the finger of
gesticulating pride as being among his outlets
(it would be better for him if they were
among his souvenirs), his business is handled
through thirty or forty jobbers. Naturally
each of his customers is a very
important unit in the business.</p>

<p>The loss of one account is serious.</p>

<p>So a customer to him is an outlet for
business greater than the trade a big department
store gets from a hundred good
customers. One customer to him is as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
score of customers to the manufacturer who
sells to the retail trade.</p>

<p>To him, then, a complaint from a San
Antonio jobber that the buttons on his
pants aren't right has all the importance
that the same complaint, echoed by a hundred
different customers, would have to the
retail merchant. Looked at in this light,
is it not logical that any complaint&mdash;no
matter how trifling its nature&mdash;should have
his prompt, personal attention? Had he
but known it, the letters he turned over to
Henry were danger signals. They warned
of the need for GUARDING THE WELFARE
OF THE BUSINESS&mdash;LOOKING
AFTER ITS GENERAL GOOD
HEALTH.</p>

<p>And that task, as we have said, overshadows
in importance every other task
which the successful manager, in his daily
business of managing, may have to perform.</p>

<p>The maintenance foreman in a New
England mill walked into the agent's office<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
one day&mdash;why the manager of a mill is
called an agent is just one of those things&mdash;and
said:</p>

<p>"Something's got to be done about that
freight elevator over in Building C, Mr.
Dearle. I've monkeyed with it and monkeyed
with it. It's just worn out, and one
of these fine days, it's going to drop a
couple of floors and pile up in the basement."</p>

<p>And one fine day it did. You see, the
manager was all tied up in a labor controversy.
Labor squabbles aren't any fun.
And presumably their speedy settlement is
far more important to the business than the
matter of what to do about a tired freight
elevator which has seen far better days.</p>

<p>So Frank the maintenance man had to
run along and sell his papers. And the elevator
kept on working.</p>

<p>The day it quit, Henry Fitts was aboard.
And when the elevator man picked himself
up off the cellar floor, Henry couldn't.</p>

<p>But why go into that? Henry's broken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
leg and Henry's lost time cost the company
more than a new elevator. And Henry was
one of the company's best technical men.
Lots of bum sheets and pillow cases got
made and shipped and returned while
Henry was laid up. The damage done by
that falling elevator could hardly be measured
in dollars.</p>

<p>Now, then, settling the differences of
capital and labor was a big job to the mill
agent. Saying "No" to Frank was merely
postponing a trifling detail. Yet what a
heap of difference a "Yes" would have
made. That defective elevator, because it
endangered lives, overshadowed all else in
importance, had the agent viewed his job
from the standpoint of CARING FOR
THE BUSINESS. THE KNACK OF
SAFEGUARDING ITS WELFARE lies
not merely in doing tasks that preserve the
safety of the business or job, but also in
the ability to discern when such tasks are
really mere trifles, and when, because of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
their potential effect, they are details vital
to the life of the business.</p>

<p>How is a manager to know when he shall
devote his entire attention to settling wage
rates, and when listen to the maintenance
man's song? How can the president of a
million-dollar concern tell when it is good
business to drop a tremendously important
managerial task and listen to a customer's
tale of woe about pants buttons&mdash;and personally
set the complaint right?</p>

<p>How, on the other hand, are you to know
when to lay off such tasks?</p>

<p>Some few men&mdash;seventh sons of seventh
sons&mdash;may be born with that instinct or
knowledge. The rest of us must cultivate
a true knack of conserving the business&mdash;a
knack which carries with it the finest
sense of discrimination and the best of business
judgment.</p>

<p>And not until we have acquired this important
knack and added to it all the other
knacks we've been talking about, can we
consider ourselves successful managers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Not until then shall we have acquired THE
TRUE KNACK OF MANAGING.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I've learned how to pick out the tasks
that are vital to the business and make
them my own special responsibilities," a
successful newspaper publisher once said,
"by setting up a sort of yardstick to judge
every job that comes along.</p>

<p>"My paper was in the 'red' when I
bought it. It was a weak sister. It carried
the least advertising, had the least circulation
and exercised the least influence. Today
its lineage is nearly one-third more than
its nearest competitor's&mdash;and circulation
has more than doubled in four years, so
now it tops all the rest.</p>

<p>"I analyzed my job something like this:
I bought the paper because I thought I
could make money with it. To make
money, I must carry a large volume of advertising.
To get advertising, I must show
results to advertisers. To show results, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
must make my paper a real "home" paper&mdash;a
paper really read and appreciated&mdash;not
merely a paper with which people are only
satisfied. To get that kind of circulation,
I must put into the paper what people who
read a paper at home wouldn't 'miss for
anything.'</p>

<p>"What did this analysis show me? Simply
this: That while more advertising and
more circulation meant more profits, the
attitude of <i>my</i> readers toward <i>their</i> paper
meant even more&mdash;it meant business life
or death.</p>

<p>"So my yardstick is never to let anything
get by me that might change our
standing with our readers. The toughest
business problem is shoved aside when
something comes up that means loss of
respect among our public.</p>

<p>"I made it my first business to get to
know our type of reader. Never was a
good hand at guessing. So had to learn
about human nature.</p>

<p>"After a lot of hiring and firing, picking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
and sorting, coaching and drilling, I got me
four women who could go out and get exactly
the kind of information I had to have.</p>

<p>"Each of the four took a section of the
city. Each section represented a distinct
type of home-dweller&mdash;and it takes all
kinds of people to run a world, you know&mdash;or
to buy a newspaper.</p>

<p>"Every week those four women canvassed
close to a thousand homes between
them. Their method was to tell the housewife
that we were going to deliver our
paper free for a week&mdash;and hoped they'd
take it in and read it. A week later they
went back over the same ground, soliciting
subscriptions, of course, but also gathering
information for me.</p>

<p>"More important than getting a subscription
was finding out why a woman
subscribed&mdash;or why she wouldn't subscribe.
They asked what the women thought about
certain special features.</p>

<p>"I got a lot of good pointers. For instance,
I'd been a bitter opponent of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
'funnies.' But I put them back when I
learned that people really wanted them.
You see, I was getting a good cross section
of the likes and dislikes of all my customers
and my prospects.</p>

<p>"After the 'funnies' were in&mdash;and after
various other changes had been made&mdash;I
sent my four scouts back once more to tell
of the improvements. Then we checked the
new reports with the old ones. There was
plenty of deadwood. I knew there would
be. But there was enough good live stuff
to furnish food for thought.</p>

<p>"Some needed changes couldn't be made
right away. Many people preferred a competing
paper because it carried more department
store ads. Well, I couldn't do
anything about that for the moment. But
I could and did improve the sports page,
put in more home-stuff for the women, more
society news, funnier 'funnies' and so on.
Those were things our readers wanted
which I could gradually give them.</p>

<p>"Then it was time to tackle the adver<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>tising
problem. I had my ammunition.
Carried a bunch of reports around with me.
Told the merchants frankly what I was
up to. Showed them the reports from
women who said they'd subscribe if we had
more advertising as well as the reports from
those who did subscribe for certain good
reasons.</p>

<p>"And I quoted a rate on what we were
worth at the time, not on what I knew we
could do in the future. I didn't begrudge
a full day spent in one small store, if that
small store advertised the stuff I felt was
wanted by the people I wanted for readers.</p>

<p>"Well, they came 'round one by one&mdash;the
stores and the people. And I think
the results prove that I was keeping busy
on the right tasks&mdash;the tasks on which the
welfare of my business depends&mdash;and not
on the tasks that mean only increased
<i>volume</i>.</p>

<p>"How does it affect my readers? That
is my yardstick for measuring everything
about my business. That is my guide to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
whether or not I should worry. If a little
error in last night's paper has the power
to affect my readers' opinion of the paper,
then it's my job to run it down to earth,
find out how it happened&mdash;and see that it
never happens again. But if there's a big
advertising contract in the offing which
won't affect the permanent standing of the
paper in any way whatsoever&mdash;except to
increase the number of dollars that come
clinking into the coffers&mdash;I don't give thirty
seconds of my time to it. I hire a sales
manager to do that. That's his job. The
other's mine.</p>

<p>"I'll spend a week with my managing
editor trying to figure out a way to get our
afternoon editions on the street a few minutes
earlier. It may involve some minor
change in the pressroom running into only
a few hundred dollars&mdash;but it does affect
our permanent place in the sun. On the
other hand, the managing editor can go
ahead and spend $5000 of my good money
on something that has nothing to do with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
our readers' interest, and all I'll do is okay
the expenditure. He'll do the worrying this
time."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You and I aren't interested in the way
this publisher went about building up
his newspaper. That is to say, we don't care
anything about his female quartette who
went around and sang the paper's praises.
His methods were sound, of course, and
merit attention. But our interest right now
is in his division between the tasks he
watched personally and the tasks he left
his business manager or his managing editor
to work out for themselves.</p>

<p>Strip off the publishing scenery&mdash;just as
a moment ago we stripped off the individual
characteristics of a totally different business&mdash;and
you find that HIS DIVISION
IS APPLICABLE NOT ONLY TO ANY
BUSINESS, BUT TO ANY SINGLE JOB.
Which means once more that that's the way
the successful manager of a steel mill or of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
peanut stand will divide the tasks which
confront him from nine to five every day.</p>

<p>Who are your "readers"?</p>

<p>Every business, every job has its "readers"&mdash;some
element which, once injured or
neglected, affects the welfare, the health,
the profits, or the ultimate success of the
business or job.</p>

<p>A file clerk may acquire tremendous
speed in putting letters away in drawers,
but if she can't get you the correspondence
you need at a moment's notice, what good
is all her speed? Your stenographer may
keep up with you in your best and fastest
moments of dictation, but if her finished
letters don't say what you said, her facility
isn't worth the proverbial thin dime. An
accountant may work out a cost system that
reflects conditions like a mirror, but what
of it if his reports come out so late that
they're ancient history by the time the
plant manager gets them? A miller may
produce a flour that contains more vitamins
than any other flour on the market, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
if the dough won't rise properly, it isn't
much use. A small-town banker may have
splendid reserves and a strong cash position,
but he's going to lose your business
if he asks 6&frac12; per cent interest and 3 per
cent commission to extend your mortgage
when the big-city bank offers you the same
loan at 6 per cent interest and 2&frac12; per cent
commission. That messenger boy of ours&mdash;no
chapter is complete without him&mdash;may
run all the way from the Tribune
Tower to State and Madison, but what if
in his haste he loses the message?</p>

<p>There is, then, in every business or job
a VITAL ELEMENT. And no one can
do a good job of managing unless he finds
out definitely what that element is, and
then proceeds to guard it through all the
hustle and bustle of cost cutting, labor saving
and so on.</p>

<p>One manager put it pretty plainly to his
billing clerk. The latter tried out some
short cuts. They were splendid from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
billers' point of view. Saved time and
money. But the customers weren't used
to any of this new-fangled stuff and kicked
like steers. They couldn't check the invoices.
Or wouldn't.</p>

<p>"They just won't use their heads. It's
all as simple as ABC," protested the billing
clerk when the manager called him in on
the carpet. "All they've got to do is check
the numbers on the cartons against the
numbers on the invoices. There's no need
of all the description we've been giving
them."</p>

<p>"Right you are, Johnson," replied the
manager. "But sometimes you bump up
against a stone wall when you try to educate
the trade. Oftentimes life's too short.
Your system saves us money. It's good up
to a certain point. That point is where
your labor saving and cost cutting begin
to have an adverse effect on sales or sales
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I've seen you playing bridge at noon,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
he went on. "You score honors above the
line, don't you? Below the line you keep
your game score. If you hold 80 or 90
honors in your hand, it affects your play.
But you can't give your entire attention to
scoring above the line, for after all it's the
score below which determines who wins
games and rubbers.</p>

<p>"You can score your job in pretty much
the same way. All this work you're doing
along cost-cutting lines is fine. Those
things determine the size of your department's
profits. Sketch them out on a card
and check them over and add to them. But
below the line put down the main object of
your work&mdash;to have your invoices correct
and to have them so plain that no customer
can fail to understand them. Keep plugging
away above the line. Don't let me
discourage any effort that will reduce costs.
They're all-important. But at the same
time keep your eye below the line and make
sure your game score is piling up. That<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
sort of thinking and playing wins in business
just as it does in bridge."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's a long time since we've drawn any
charts. Let's study the newspaper publisher's
policy and see if he wasn't doing
mentally just what the manager recommended
that his billing clerk do on paper.</p>

<p>You remember he made it his business
to find out all about the error in last night's
paper and to prevent its occurring again.
That was something which, to his way of
thinking, affected the permanent standing
of his paper. When the department store
stood ready to start a big institutional campaign
which meant nothing more to his
business than a big increase in volume, he
left the job of closing the contract to his
hired help. But when, in another newspaper,
the same department store advertised
a new type of radio which he thought
his readers ought to know about, once more
he made it his own business to go out and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
get a few lines for his own paper and his
own readers.</p>

<p>Then, if we keep tally&mdash;and consider
whether they "score" above the line as increased
profits, or below the line as permanent
success, our card will look something
like the chart on this page.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">
<img src="images/illus195.jpg" width="800" height="590" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The handling of the error in last night's
paper is something that will score down
where the success of the business lies&mdash;and
to lose on it means losing a vital point.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
In short, it affects the permanent standing
of the business enterprise. So does the securing
of the radio advertisement. It's
business news and something his readers
must know about. So after it he goes. On
the other hand, the institutional advertising
will add only to the revenue of the newspaper.
Don't mistake the point. He wants
that contract, too. It will add materially
to his profits. But getting it or not getting
it will in no way affect the standing of the
paper with its customers. School will keep
just the same. So that particular job is on
the other side of the line. That's why he
has a sales manager.</p>

<p>To illustrate once more, let's attempt to
"score" the work of a credit man. What
is the "vital element" in his work? What
determines whether his work is worth doing,
or whether it's worthless? Offhand,
you might say: "Preventing losses on bad
debts." But is it that? Surely not, when
we analyze the job. The final objective
of the credit department is to enable the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
house to sell more goods by extending credit
wherever it is justified. On that basis it
is easy to see that the "vital element" in
the credit man's job is "to not lose a good
sale"&mdash;and we know we're splitting an infinitive
to say it. If it weren't, why have
a credit man at all? It would be far simpler
not to extend credit to anyone who
could not prove his worth.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">
<img src="images/illus197.jpg" width="800" height="576" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Now look at the credit man's score card.
Such a chart might not help an old, ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>perienced
hand, but would it not help a
beginner to get a grip on what his job is
all about? Would it not enable him to see
his job from the angle of CONSERVING
THE BUSINESS?</p>

<p>Hold on, though. Lining up the various
jobs according to whether they score
"above or below the line"&mdash;that is, whether
they affect the essential well-being of the
business or simply swell its profit&mdash;does
not mean that he shall neglect all tasks
above the line any more than give his constant
attention to those that score below the
line. The chief value of such an outline of
your job or business is to KEEP ACTIVELY
IN MIND A SENSE OF THE
VITAL SPOTS TO GUARD&mdash;the spots to
keep an eye on&mdash;the tasks for which you
are always ready to plunge in and defend,
once they are threatened.</p>

<p>Wherever you find a successful manager,
whether running a big business or just
handling a small job, you will see that he
has a clear understanding of the elements<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
that mean the life of his work. And further
observation will show that he is always
protecting them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The head miller in a small flour mill was
smart and aggressive&mdash;a bit on the "go-getter"
order, to be sure, but very, very
competent none the less. It seems he had
worked out some method of increasing the
nutritive value of the mill's best grade of
flour by adding something or other&mdash;it
doesn't matter what.</p>

<p>Naturally he was enthusiastic.</p>

<p>Why not? He had persuaded the manager
to have this new product analyzed by
experts&mdash;and the analyses had proved extremely
favorable.</p>

<p>He wanted to go ahead.</p>

<p>But the manager moved slowly. "It may
make a good flour and the bread made from
it may be good for the digestion," said he,
"but will the bread taste as good?"</p>

<p>Finally, after trying out the flour in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
own home, he refused to go ahead with the
project. The miller, knowing how good the
bread would be for people, fired up his job,
went into business for himself and put his
trick flour on the market.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">
<img src="images/illus200.jpg" width="800" height="595" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>It never sold.</p>

<p>The bread baked from it didn't taste
good.</p>

<p>The mill owner, you see, had kept his
eye on what the miller had neglected&mdash;the
big, vital element of the business&mdash;that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
people bought flour to make bread, and that
anything affecting the quality and taste of
the bread must therefore be handled very
carefully.</p>

<p>What the miller needed, to take the
place of the boss's years of experience, was
a chart like the one on the opposite page&mdash;a
graphic outline in skeleton form of his
work's vital element.</p>

<p>What a different aspect could be put on
many an employee's work if the employer,
instead of depending on the man's own-farsightedness
in seeing the main items of
value in his work, would graphically put
them before him by some such chart as this
one!</p>

<p>Right here, however, we must guard
against one important characteristic of this
vital element.</p>

<p>It CHANGES&mdash;or at least it <i>may</i> change
as the business develops.</p>

<p>Ask the manager of the circularizing department
of a certain mail-order house. He
will tell you it's VOLUME. All his other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
problems have been stabilized except the
single job of getting out enough circulars
every day to keep the required volume of
orders flowing in. Again, go to the circularizing
room of an Eastern financial house
and the manager will tell you that the vital
element in his work is QUALITY&mdash;quality
addressing, quality folding and so on. Here
the whole success of the department depends
upon reflecting the dignity and prestige
of the house. The danger point with
this manager is therefore touched by anything
that might affect the quality of the
work.</p>

<p>Many a manufacturer starts with limited
capital. For the first year or two the vital
element in his business is finance. He may
have to sacrifice attention to production
and sales problems in order to guard the
slender balance in the bank. Sometimes
he may have to pay higher prices for materials
because he must buy in small quantities;
he may even have to check sales
because he hasn't the capital with which to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
finance them. Later, though, as a reserve
is built up, or when better credit is established,
he will find the vital element has
shifted to manufacturing, buying, or maybe
sales.</p>

<p>A certain shoe manufacturer&mdash;we seem
to gravitate toward shoes every so often&mdash;found
manufacturing the vital element of
his business a scant dozen years ago. His
big job was to see that shoes went out the
door. He doubled the size of his plant.
In the short space of three years his problem
had shifted to one of sales&mdash;he was no
longer getting enough volume to fill his
plants. And today his greatest concern is
his shrinking bank balance.</p>

<p>The same tendency toward change will
be found in individual jobs.</p>

<p>The traffic manager of an electrical supply
house deposes that the vital element in
his department's work changed completely
in less than two years.</p>

<p>"When I first came here," he declares,
"the business had grown faster than our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
manufacturing facilities. We were always
working close up to the contract date for
delivery. I was hired simply because I had
a reputation for being able to speed up
shipping, pick the shortest routes and rush
things through at the last minute.</p>

<p>"Later on, we got in better shape in the
factory. The goods began to come through
to us further in advance of the promised
delivery dates. I noticed this and changed
my methods. Where I had previously
watched after speed alone, slapping things
into any old case to get them packed, hustling
them out by any route which would
save a day, regardless of rates, I now began
to pack more carefully, to sort mixed shipments
in order to get the lowest classification
in freight rates, to pick the cheapest
routes, and so on.</p>

<p>"One day the chief called me in and gave
me a raise.</p>

<p>"'Warren,' said he, 'I thought I'd have
to fire you when we got past the rush stage.
I had you down as just a speed demon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
But you have been wise enough to change
your methods as conditions changed. And
I want you to know we appreciate it.'"</p>

<p>A similar shift is noted by the managing
editor of a well-known business paper.</p>

<p>"When I took hold five years ago, it was
a constant fight against time. We never
had quite enough material on hand. There
was always a mad scramble at the last moment
to put the book to bed. Night after
night I stuck around writing fillers&mdash;a column
here, half a column there.</p>

<p>"Today it's quite a different story. We
have a carefully selected inventory from
which we make up our schedules at least 60
days ahead of publication. We have figured
out close production dates&mdash;and we
stick to 'em. There's no longer the problem
of digging up enough eleventh-hour
material to get out an issue. The job is
one of selection. My biggest care is to find
room for all the things I know our readers
are interested in."</p>

<p>A constant check is the safest way to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
note in time the conditions that govern the
conservation of the welfare of your job or
business. Check the POINTS ABOVE
THE LINE and watch the POINTS BELOW
THE LINE.</p>

<p>That constant effort to measure the importance
of all the things that come up
before him by their effects above and below
THE DANGER LINE will do much to
keep a manager practical. For summed
up, the "practical" man is the one who
combines with his progressiveness and
vision the knack of never letting his progressive
ideas puncture the vital element of
his business and bleed it to death.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Make your score in any form that
fits your needs or your tastes, but
MAKE IT&mdash;WATCH IT&mdash;ACT ON IT.
Some men can do the scoring in their heads.
Most of us, even in so simple a procedure as
keeping our golf scores, find it's better to
carry it on paper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>On paper? Can a man with real work
to do, spend his time plotting curves and
making pie charts? Does the Knack of
Managing depend upon a man's ability to
draw pictures?</p>

<p>Not at all. If that's the impression you
have gained from reading this little book,
go back to the beginning and start all over
again.</p>

<p>If, from time to time, charts and diagrams
have been suggested, it is only because
the successful manager has somehow
or other to go through precisely those same
motions. His job&mdash;if he is to understand
it and manage it successfully&mdash;must be
analyzed somehow, sometime. We have
merely suggested ways in which the
ANALYSIS can be made more easily and
intelligently by means of charts.</p>

<p>His operations must be planned&mdash;in his
head or on paper&mdash;if he is to perform them
with the least lost motion, lost time and
lost money. The Knack of Managing has
simply gathered from other men's methods<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
a form of chart by which PLANNING can
be done more accurately.</p>

<p>Again, his work must be organized&mdash;if it
is to be done in the simplest and best way.
An attempt, then, has been made to sift
the organization methods of successful
managers and firms to develop a chart
which at least indicates how to go about
ORGANIZING THE WORK.</p>

<p>"HELP" MUST BE HANDLED. So,
from the experiences of shrewd managers,
we have dug out the gist of their ideas and
put it in the form of a chart that gives a
basis on which to work.</p>

<p>Above all, a business or job must be
CONSERVED AND CARED FOR. The
charting method suggested is but the
method used by every successful manager&mdash;though
he does not take the time to
reduce his plans to paper.</p>

<p>And last, in our search to acquire THE
KNACK OF MANAGING, have we not
learned that the fundamental principles of
management are universally applicable?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>More than anything else we have seen
why the manager who has made a success
in one business can step right into another
and make the same brilliant record. His
business, after all, is not ships or shoes or
sewing machines. It's MANAGING. And
that job, in its fundamental principles, is
the same, whether it's running the U. S.
Steel Corporation or operating a peanut
stand.</p>

<p>That's our story&mdash;and we'll stick to it.</p>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

</ul>

<p>1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set

Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

<h3>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

<h3>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<h3>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
